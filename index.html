<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Auschwitz Volunteer: Beyond Bravery</h2><p>In 1940, the Polish Underground wanted to know what was happening inside the recently opened Auschwitz concentration camp. Polish army officer Witold Pilecki volunteered to be arrested by the Germans and reported from inside the camp. His intelligence reports, smuggled out in 1941, were among the first eyewitness accounts of Auschwitz atrocities: the extermination of Soviet POWs, its function as a camp for Polish political prisoners, and the &#x201c;final solution&#x201d; for Jews. Pilecki received brutal treatment until he escaped in April 1943; soon after, he wrote a brief report. This book is the first English translation of a 1945 expanded version. In the foreword, Poland's chief rabbi states, &#x201c;If heeded, Pilecki's early warnings might have changed the course of history.&#x201d; Pilecki's story was suppressed for half a century after his 1948 arrest by the Polish Communist regime as a &#x201c;Western spy.&#x201d; He was executed and expunged from Polish history. Pilecki writes in staccato style but also interjects his observations on humankind's lack of progress: &#x201c;We have strayed, my friends, we have strayed dreadfully... we are a whole level of hell worse than animals!&#x201d; These remarkable revelations are amplified by 40 b&amp;w photos, illus., and maps.</p><p>Soldier, Patriot...<br>Husband, Father...Hero<br><br>Captain Witold Pilecki&#x2014;the only man who volunteered to be captured and imprisoned in Auschwitz to bring out the story of the camp.<br><br>September 1940.

A new chapter has been included on individual development and personal religion, and there is a new section on music and language as facilitators of religious experience. Also, the authors present the latest version of their three-dimensional model for assessing personal religion as a means, end, and quest, and include clarification and evaluation of that model in light of criticisms of earlier versions. Nearly 100 studies done during the last decade have been added to the analysis of the relation between personal religion and mental health, and recent evidence has been included to expand the discussion of the social consequences of personal religion. This fascinating, controversial work will challenge and enlighten students of psychology, sociology, and religious studies.<br></p><p>C. Daniel Batson is at University of Kansas, Lawrence.

William James believed that individual religious experiences, rather than the precepts of organized religions, were the backbone of the world&#39;s religious life. His discussions of conversion, repentance, mysticism and saintliness, and his observations on actual, personal religious experiences - all support this thesis. In his introduction, Martin E. Marty discusses how James&#39; pluralistic view of religion led to his remarkable tolerance of extreme forms of religious behaviour, his challenging, highly original theories, and his welcome lack of pretension in all of his observations on the individual and the divine.</p><p><i>"I am neither a theologian, nor a scholar learned in the history of religions, nor an anthropologist. Psychology is the only branch of learning in which I am particularly versed. To the psychologist the religious propensities of man must be at least as interesting as any other of the facts pertaining to his mental constitution. It would seem, therefore, as a psychologist, the natural thing for me would be to invite you to a descriptive survey of those religious propensities."</i> <p> When William James went to the University of Edinburgh in 1901 to deliver a series of lectures on "natural religion," he defined religion as "the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine." Considering religion, then, not as it is defined by--or takes place in--the churches, but as it is felt in everyday life, he undertook a project that, upon completion, stands not only as one of the most important texts on psychology ever written, not only as a vitally serious contemplation of spirituality, but for many critics one of the best works of nonfiction written in the 20th century. Reading <i>The Varieties of Religious Experience</i>, it is easy to see why. Applying his analytic clarity to religious accounts from a variety of sources, James elaborates a pluralistic framework in which "the divine can mean no single quality, it must mean a group of qualities, by being champions of which in alternation, different men may all find worthy missions." It's an intellectual call for serious religious tolerance--indeed, respect--the vitality of which has not diminished through the subsequent decades.</p>"<b>The Varieties of Religious Experience</b> is certainly the most notable of all books in the field of the psychology of religion and probably destined to be the most influential [one] written on religion in the twentieth century," said Walter Houston Clark in <b>Psychology Today</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The book was an immediate bestseller upon its publication in June 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflecting the pluralistic views of psychologist-turned-philosopher William James, it posits that individual religious experiences, rather than the tenets of organized religions, form the backbone of religious life.&nbsp;&nbsp;James's discussion of conversion, repentance, mysticism, and hope of reward and fears of punishment in the hereafter--as well as his observations on the religious experiences of such diverse thinkers as Voltaire, Whitman, Emerson, Luther, Tolstoy, and others--all support his thesis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"James's characteristic humor, his ability to put down the pretentious and to be unpretentious, and his willingness to take some risks in his choices of ancedotal data or provocative theories are all apparent in the book," noted Professor Martin E. Marty.&nbsp;&nbsp;"A reader will come away with more reasons to raise new questions than to feel that old ones have been resolved."</p><h2>PRENTICE HALL LITERATURE TIMELESS VOICES TIMELESS THEMES 7TH EDITION STUDENT EDITION GRADE 11 2002C</h2><p>Book by Prentice hall literature</p><p></p><h2>The Technical Collection of Intelligence</h2><p><p>Technical collection represents the largest asymmetric edge that technologically advanced countries such as the United States and its allies have in the intelligence business.

At once romantic, sensuous, comic, and somber, <i>Brideshead Revisited</i> transcends Waugh&#x2019;s familiar satiric exploration of his cast of lords and ladies, Catholics and eccentrics, artists and misfits, revealing him to be an elegiac, lyrical novelist of the utmost feeling and lucidity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The edition reprinted here contains Waugh&#x2019;s revisions, made in 1959, and his preface to the revised edition.</p></p><p>A departure from Evelyn Waugh's normally comic theater, <b>Brideshead Revisited</b> concerns the tale of Charles Ryder, a captain in the British Army in post-World War I England.

He strikes a special friendship with Lord Sebastian Flyte as the setting moves to the Brideshead estate and a baroque castle that recalls England's prior standing in the world. Ryder falls for Flyte's sister while families, politics and religions collide. What makes the book extraordinary is Waugh's sharp, vivid style and his use of dialect and minor characters.

But forensic analysis has been practiced for thousands of years.

In the intervening decades, forensic science has evolved to use the most cutting-edge, innovative techniques and technologies.</p><p>In this book, acclaimed author Bridget Heos uses real-life cases to tell the history of modern forensic science, from the first test for arsenic poisoning to fingerprinting, firearm and blood spatter analysis, DNA evidence, and all the important milestones in between. By turns captivating and shocking, <em>Blood, Bullets, and Bones</em> demonstrates the essential role forensic science has played in our criminal justice system.</p></p><p><p>Bridget Heos is the author of "Mustache Baby"and "Mustache Baby Meets His Match, "as well as many nonfiction books for young readers. She lives in Kansas City, Missouri, with her husband and four children. Visit her website at www.authorbridgetheos.com.</p>Gr 8 Up&#x2014;The use of DNA evidence by forensic scientists to help solve crimes is a relatively new innovation. It was only in 1994 that the FBI created a database of DNA samples from convicted and suspected criminals called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). However, the field of forensic science has been around for centuries. In fact, as early as 270 CE there was Zhang Ju, a Chinese coroner who wrote about the crimes he solved by examining the bodies of the victims. Using numerous real-life cases, Heos presents a riveting history of the evolution of modern forensic science. One of the first scientific tests ever developed in relation to murder was one for determining the presence of poison, in particular arsenic. This 18th-century breakthrough laid the groundwork for countless other developments in the quest to solve crimes. Heos deftly incorporates the stories behind many murders to illuminate advancements in areas such as fingerprint evidence, firearm and blood pattern analysis, and forensic anthropology (how bodies decompose). Also covered are the rise of the medical examiner, the advent of criminal profilers, and the development of DNA evidence. The text, with photographs sprinkled throughout, is gripping and easy to read but not for the faint of heart. VERDICT Sherlock Holmes lovers, CSI: Miami aficionados, and forensic science students will all be drawn to this rather gruesome yet highly entertaining and fact-packed history.&#x2014;Ragan O'Malley, Saint Ann's School, Brooklyn</p><h2>Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Leatherbound Classics Series)</h2><p>This complete and unabridged edition contains every word that Shakespeare wrote �&#x20ac;&#x201d; all 37 tragedies, comedies, and histories, plus the sonnets.

Trade is a cornerstone concept in economics, taught in all departments both in the United States and abroad. The past twenty years have seen a number of new theoretical approaches that are essential to any graduate international trade course, and will be of interest in development economics and other fields. Here, Robert Feenstra steps beyond theory to consider empirical evidence as well. He covers all the basic material including the Ricardian and Hecksher-Ohlin models, extension to many goods and factors, and the role of tariffs, quotas, and other trade policies; recent material including imperfect competition, outsourcing, political economy, multinationals, and endogenous growth; and new material including the gravity equation and the organization of the firm in international trade.</p><p>Throughout the book, special emphasis is placed on integrating the theoretical models with empirical evidence, and this is supplemented by theoretical and empirical exercises that appear with each chapter. <i>Advanced International Trade</i> is intended to bring readers to the forefront of knowledge in international trade and prepare them to undertake their own research. Both graduate students and faculty will find a wealth of topics that have previously only been covered in journal articles, and are dealt with here in a common and simple notation. In addition to known results, the book includes some particularly important unpublished results by various authors. Two appendices describe empirical methods applicable to research problems in international trade, methods that draw on (i) index numbers and (ii) discrete choice models. Thoroughly up-to-date and marked by clear, straightforward prose, this book will be used widely--and enthusiastically.</p></p><p><p>"No other book in advanced international trade matches this one in providing a clear, complete, up-to-date, balanced, and systematic summary of international trade theory and evidence. Its impact on the graduate education and scholarly research of international trade will be felt for years to come."<b>--Bin Xu, University of Florida</b></p><p>"In fifteen years of teaching this material I have never used a textbook. Thanks to Robert Feenstra, my students are about to experience a dramatic change for the better. When I have a question about international trade I immediately turn to Rob Feenstra for answers and insights. He is the most distinguished empirical researcher in the field today. Not surprisingly, this book reflects both his awesome scholarship and his ability to communicate ideas simply."<b>--Daniel Trefler, University of Toronto</b></p><p>"This book is a tremendous contribution. It will quickly become 'the' main textbook in graduate international trade classes, and will be a useful reference for many others interested in the field. It is very up-to-date and is unique in emphasizing empirical testing and results, precisely what most trade economists are doing these days."<b>--Douglas Irwin, Dartmouth College, author of<i>Free Trade Under Fire</i></b></p><p>"Feenstra covers his topics fabulously. I hope--for the sake of our field--that this book will help to complete a revolution already underway in turning the study of international trade from speculation into a science."<b>--Donald Davis, Columbia University</b></p><b>Robert C.

Barely two decades after Pierre le Moyne, Sieur d&#x2019;Iberville, led the first band of settlers to Louisiana in 1699, the plantation idea began to take root. Fertile soil, a mild climate, and the transport potential of the Mississippi River were the resources that allowed men of vision, initiative, and determination to accumulate untold wealth. These resources also enabled them to construct extravagant mansions that would survive economic upheavals, the Civil War, and natural disasters.</p> <p>The era they represented is now cloaked in history, but many of these magnificent homes still stand. Although ravaged by the Civil War, Reconstruction, and periodic neglect, several dozen have been meticulously restored to their original splendor by preservation groups and determined owners imbued with a sense of responsibility to history. The results of these loving, time-consuming, and often costly restoration efforts are pictured in these pages in stunning full-color photographs.</p> <p>Usually constructed of cypress and other materials from the surrounding land, the homes feature soaring Greek columns, hipped roofs, gabled roofs, dormer windows, balconies, galleries, ceiling frescoes, and formal ballrooms. Riverboats brought the finishing touches&#x2015;wallcoverings, chandeliers, and marble statuary&#x2015;from the finest manufacturers in Europe.</p> <p>In refurbishing many of the homes depicted in this volume, restorers consulted old documents, diaries, and personal papers of the original owners. As a result, many of the houses feature rooms decorated with the original colors, period antiques, and recreations of the original drapes.</p> <p>The late Paul and Lee Malone collaborated on several books on the Louisiana area. Mr. Malone (d. 1993) was a critically acclaimed portrait photographer and was considered to be a master in his field. To each of the books he contributed photographs and Mrs. Malone (d. 2007) provided historical information. Together, they created eight masterful books depicting the true beauty behind many of Louisiana&#x2019;s historic sites.

Crystal makes a simple argument-that since playing with language is so natural, a natural way to learn language is to play with it-while he discusses puns, crosswords, lipograms, comic alphabets, rhymes, funny voices taken from dialect and popular culture, limericks, anagrams, scat singing, and much more.</p></p><p>Language play takes different forms for different people. Some people groove on crossword puzzles; others gravitate toward Scrabble. Still others like to rap, tell jokes, speak in puns, or recite <i>Monty Python</i> skits verbatim. What they all have in common--what we all have in common, says linguist David Crystal--is a love of language play. "The phenomenon of language play," he writes, "seems to cut across regional, social and professional background, age, sex, ethnicity, personality, intelligence and culture." As it turns out, little research has been done on the subject. Language exists, it is usually thought, to communicate ideas. Crystal argues that "it is difficult to see how ping-pong punning can possibly fit in with [this] view." <p> In <i>Language Play</i>, Crystal explores the various ways in which people play with language. He outlines the professions--including advertising, headline writing, and comedy--that rely on language play. He talks about the importance of play in language development, even for the infants. And he argues that the printed matter used in schools (he lives in the U.K., by the way) sorely needs updating to reflect children's interest in rhyme, nonsense, pattern, new words, and the like. Examples new and old (from the 1800s) demonstrate the ways in which language can entertain.

In fact, he says, "disaffection with someone's language play is ... a sign that a relationship is on the way to breaking down."

The second half of the sixteenth century was a period of intense conflict between the nations of Europe, and between competing Catholic and Protestant beliefs. These struggles produced acute anxiety in England, but the nation was saved from the disasters that befell her neighbors and, by the end of Elizabeth's reign, achieved a remarkable sense of political and religious identity.<br> In this masterly and comprehensive study, Penry Williams explains how this process came about. He begins by weaving together the political, religious,and economic history of the nation, setting out the workings and development of the English state. Later chapters establish the broader perspective, with a thorough analysis of English society, family relations, and culture, focusing on the ways in which art and literature were used to uphold--and sometimes to subvert--the social and political order. The final chapter looks to Europe and across the seas at England's part in the shaping of the New World.</p><p>The Later Tudors tells the story of England between the accession of Edward VI and the death of Elizabeth I.

This vastly inhospitable location, called the playa, is the site of Burning Man, where, within a 9-mile fence, artists called Burners create a temporary city devoted to art and participation. Braving extreme elements, over two hundred wildly ambitious works of art are created and intended to delight, provoke, involve, or amaze. In 2013, over 68,000 people attended - the highest number ever allowed on the playa. As Burning Man has created new context, new categories of art have emerged since its inception, including Art to Ride, Collaborative Art, and of course, Art to Burn. <i>Burning Man: Art on Fire</i> is an authorized collection of some of the most stunning examples of Burning Man art. Experience the amazing sculptures, art, stories, and interviews from the world's greatest gathering of artists. Get lost in a rich gallery of images showcasing the best examples of playa art with 170 photos. Interviews with the artists reveal not only their motivation to create art specifically for Burning Man, but they also illuminate the dramatic efforts it took to create their pieces. Featuring the incredible photography of long-time Burning Man photographers, <b>Sidney Erthal</b> and <b>Scott London</b>, an introduction from Burning Man founder<b> Larry Harvey</b>, and a foreword from <b>Will Chase<i>,</i></b> this stunning gift book allows Burners and enthusiasts alike to have a piece of Burning Man with them all year around.</p></p><p><p><b>Jennifer Raiser&nbsp;</b>is a strategist, author, and nonprofit leader based in San Francisco.

The Midwest Book Review, California Bookwatch: November 2014</b></p><br><br><p>"The desert festival known as Burning Man has evolved far beyond its 1990 origin as a simple party on a San Francisco beach centered on the immolation of a humanoid wooden sculpture. Now taking place on a dry lake bed in Nevada, the event is a giant noncommercial hedonist blowout for thousands of people revolving around a climactic incineration. This volume is an opulent photographic exploration of the artistic side of the celebration ranging from static sculpture to fire-breathing mutant cars. Short prefatory essays define Burning Man's history and ethos and give brief glimpses of the design and construction of the varied pieces on the unbelievably difficult terrain of the desert. The sculptures are as various as the minds of the creators and include free-form blobitecture, steampunk vehicles shooting flame, giant comic-book pirate ships, filigree steel female nudes, 40-ton granite boulders suspended overhead, dragon-shaped aluminum can smelters, vast wood and canvas temples, and a multiplicity of personal expressions designed to enhance the experience of the attendees. <b>VERDICT</b> The lush photography and fine printing will appeal to art and nonart audiences and the breezy text is aimed at inclusion rather than erudition. Whether you like the art pieces is a matter of taste, but this book is a great way to experience a bit of the thrill." <b>- Library Journal</b></p><br><br><p>"Burners wait all year to travel to a remote desert where they create stupefying art and build amazing sculpture - then burn it all down a week later.

Now with a new introduction, it has become even more timely in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market crash.</p><p>Rampant speculation. Record trading volumes. Assets bought not because of their value but because the buyer believes he can sell them for more in a day or two, or an hour or two. Welcome to the late 1920s. There are obvious and absolute parallels to the great bull market of the late 1990s, writes Galbraith in a new introduction dated 1997. Of course, Galbraith notes, every financial bubble since 1929 has been compared to the Great Crash, which is why this book has never been out of print since it became a bestseller in 1955.<p> Galbraith writes with great wit and erudition about the perilous actions of investors, and the curious inaction of the government. He notes that the problem wasn't a scarcity of securities to buy and sell; "the ingenuity and zeal with which companies were devised in which securities might be sold was as remarkable as anything." Those words become strikingly relevant in light of revenue-negative start-up companies coming into the market each week in the 1990s, along with fragmented pieces of established companies, like real estate and bottling plants. Of course, the 1920s were different from the 1990s. There was no safety net below citizens, no unemployment insurance or Social Security. And today we don't have the creepy investment trusts--in which shares of companies that held some stocks and bonds were sold for several times the assets' market value. But, boy, are the similarities spooky, particularly the prevailing trend at the time toward corporate mergers and industry consolidations--not to mention all the partially informed people who imagined themselves to be financial geniuses because the shares of stock they bought kept going up. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Previous ISBN 978-0-395-85999-5</p><h2>Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology</h2><p>By the time Ruether finishes, systematic theology has undergone a radical critique from which it emerges transformed rather than simply modified or totally rejected. She has constructed a full-fledged feminist theology-the first within a Christian context. <i>--The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p><i>Sexism and God-Talk</i> is one of those rare books that hits the right topic at the right time--and that has endured. Its thesis is summarized by Rosemary Radford Ruether herself (the Georgia Harkness Professor of Theology at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary) in her opening chapter and is worth quoting: "The uniqueness of feminist theology lies not in its use of the criterion of experience but rather in its use of women's experience, which has been almost entirely shut out of theological reflection in the past. The use of women's experience in feminist theology, therefore, explodes as a critical force, exposing classical theology . . . as based on male experience rather than on universal human experience." The book presents a revisioning of theological topics from a feminist perspective, including the use of male and female images of the divine in worship; the relationship between images of women, the body, and nature in Greek, Hebrew, and Christian thinking; and a new, woman-centered look at images of both Christ and Mary.<p> Clearly written, forceful without being overly dogmatic, this classic study remains what theologian Harvey Cox said of it upon its first release: "one of the most important theological books of this or any other season." --<i>Doug Thorpe</i></p>Rosemary Radford Ruether is Visiting Scholar at the Claremont Graduate University and School of Theology. She is the author of numerous influential works in feminist theology and the history of theology and the editor of many others.

The contributors&#x2014;leading scholars of ethnicity, transnationalism, globalization, and feminist theory&#x2014;are united in their determination to locate and describe the performative space of interactions between woman and nation. These are interactions, claim the contributors, that cannot be essentialized.<br> This interdisciplinarily collection investigates women in diverse locales&#x2014;ranging from Quebec to Beirut. The contributors consider such subjects as Yucatan feminism, Islamic fundamentalisms, Canadian gender formations, historic Chicana/o struggles, and Israeli/Palestinian conflicts. Divided into three parts, the collection first examines constructions of nationalism and communities whose practices complicate these constructions. The second section discusses regulations of particular nation-states and how they affect the lives of women, while the third presents studies of transnational identity formation, in which contributors critique ideas such as &#x201c;multicultural nationalism&#x201d; and &#x201c;global feminism.&#x201d; Arguing provocatively that such movements and concepts inadequately represent women&#x2019;s interests, contributors examine how such beliefs and their attendant organizations may actually bolster the very formations they ought to subvert. <br> In its demonstration of the critical possibilities of feminist alliances across discrepant and distinct material conditions, <i>Between Woman and Nation</i> will make a unique contribution to women&#x2019;s studies, feminist theory, studies of globalization and transnationalism, ethnic studies, and cultural studies. <p></p><p></p></p><p>&#34;This is a superb collection, deftly edited and wonderfully argued. Individually, the contributors expand the scope of transnationality studies to include the Middle East and Latin America. The volume as a whole focuses on important analytics: gendered imaginaries in nationalism, regulatory practices, and globablized feminism. The editors&#39; argument for immanent critique is a useful contribution to thinking and teaching feminism in an international frame.&#34;--Tani E.

This is where the 72,444 words of my latest book, <i>Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way</i>, are cooked down to fit in a 3 �-by-9 �-inch column.&nbsp; But how does one do that with a fictional story about a B movie actor's disastrous attempt to finally star in a big-budget Hollywood movie? Do you tantalize readers with snappy zingers like the one in chapter six where Biff the Wonder Boy says, "You may be bred in ol' Kentucky, but you're only a crumb up here"? Or do you reveal pivotal plot points like the one at the end of the book where the little girl on crutches points an accusing finger and shouts, "The killer is Mr. Potter!"<br>I have too much respect for you as an attention-deficient consumer to attempt such an obvious ruse. But let's not play games here. You've already picked up the book, so you either: <br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Know who I am <br>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like the cool smoking jacket I'm wearing on the cover<br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have just discovered that the bookstore restroom is out of toilet paper&nbsp; <br>Is this a relationship book? Well, if by "relationship book" you mean that the characters in it have relationships or are related to someone, then yes, absolutely. Will you learn how to pick up chicks? Good heavens, I can only hope so, though for best results in that department you should both read this book and be Brad Pitt. <br>Is it a sequel to my autobiography, <i>If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor</i>?&nbsp; Sadly, no, which made it much harder to write. According to my publisher, I haven't "done" enough since 2001 to warrant another memoir. <br>Is it an "autobiographical novel"? Yes. I'm the lead character in the story and I'm a real person and everything in the book actually happened, except for all the stuff that didn't. <br>Mostly, the action revolves around my preparations for a pivotal role in director Mike Nichols's A-list relationship film <i>Let's Make Love!</i>, starring Richard Gere, Ren�e Zellweger, and Christopher Plummer. This is the kind of break most actors can only dream of. But my Homeric attempt to break through the glass ceiling of B-grade genre fare is hampered by a vengeful studio executive and a production that becomes infected by something called the "B movie virus," symptoms of which include excessive use of cheesy special effects, slapstick, and projectile vomiting. <br>When someone fingers <i>me</i> as the guy responsible for the virus, thus ruining my good standing in the entertainment industry (hey, I said it was fiction, okay?), I become a fugitive racing against the clock, an innocent patsy battling the shadowy forces of the studio system to clear my name, save my career, and destroy the Death Star. In a jaw-dropping twist worthy of Hitchcock (page 274), you'll gasp as I turn the tables on Hollywood and attempt to salvage my reputation in a town where you're only as good as your last remake. <br>From a violent fistfight with a Buddhist to a life-altering stint in federal prison, this novel has it all. If you like John Grisham, Tom Clancy, or one too many run-on sentences, you'll absolutely love <i>Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way</i>. And if the 72,444 words are too time-consuming, there are lots and lots of cool graphics.<br>Regards,<br>Bruce "Don't Call Me Ash" Campbell <br>~<br>Bruce Campbell's first book, <i>If Chins Could Kill</i>, was a major sleeper hit<br>and became a <i>New York Times</i> and national bestseller.&nbsp; His immense energy and<br>sharp wit are in evidence again in <i>Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way</i>, a novel that will<br>have readers laughing out loud.<br><br></p><p><br>BRUCE CAMPBELL is the ultimate &#x201c;B&#x201d; actor with an ever-growing fan base. In addition to starring in the huge cult hit <i>Evil Dead</i> series and a series of independent genre films, he has had featured roles in the recent film <i>Bubba Ho-Tep, </i>the <i>Spiderman</i> movies, the blockbuster <i>Congo</i>, the award-winning independent crime drama <i>Running Time</i>, and Paramount&#x2019;s romantic comedy <i>Serving Sara. </i>Bruce has also done a lot of television work, including appearances in Disney&#x2019;s TV movies <i>Gold Rush</i> and their update of <i>The Love Bug, </i>and has also starred in the highly touted Fox series <i>The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.</i> Bruce then appeared as a recurring guest star on the hit shows <i>Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman,</i> <i>Hercules: The Legendary Journeys</i>, <i>Xena: Warrior Princess</i>, <i>Ellen</i>, and Showtime&#x2019;s edgy TV industry comedy <i>Beggars and Choosers</i>. In 2005, Bruce will be seen in <i>The Man with the Screaming Brain, </i>a film based on his own four-part comic book, that will also mark his directorial debut. He is also the author of the bestselling book <i>If Chins Could Kill.</i><br><br>Satire and sharp one-liners are the engines powering low-budget movie hero Campbell's (<i>If Chins Could Kill</i>) first autobiographical novel, a funny, breezy, high-camp affair. After dispensing B-movie witticisms on romance and navigating love scenes, Sci-Fi channel schlock film actor "Bruce Campbell" is unexpectedly offered the A-list role of a "wise-cracking doorman" and "emotional lynchpin" in the new Mike Nichols romantic comedy <i>Let's Make Love</i>, starring Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger. After getting fully immersed in calamitous role research at the Waldorf-Astoria, Campbell postures (and annoys) his way through the first read-through with indifferent cast members, runs lines with a timid Gere, crassly advises Zellweger on how to accentuate her bust line, dishes ex-husbands with Liz Taylor and berates the film's director of photography, Oscar-winning Vilmos Zsigmond (whose name Campbell spells Sigmund). After a Secret Service ambush and more movie set mayhem, Campbell's A-List luck finally runs out. But not even a bumbling S.W.A.T. team can stop this determined day player from getting his due. Campbell knows of what he writes, and this endless barrage of extreme silliness obviously spoofs (and quite possibly mirrors) a frenzied acting career made up of equal parts exasperation and hilarity. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It&#x2019;s the most asked for recipe in the book. What I love about these cookies is that if you eat them soon after they come out of the oven the chocolate chips are so meltingly delicious, it&#x2019;s like being in chocolate heaven. --<em>Sarabeth Levine</em></p> <p><strong>Makes about 2 dozen cookies</strong></p> <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p> <p>8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into �-inch cubes <br> 9 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate (no more than 62% cacao), finely chopped <br> 3 ounces unsweetened chocolate, finely chopped<br> � cup unbleached all-purpose flour<br> � teaspoon baking powder<br> � teaspoon fine sea salt<br> 3 large eggs, at room temperature<br> 1 � cups superfine sugar<br> 2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br> 2 cups (12 ounces) semisweet chocolate chips<br> 1 � cups (5 � ounces) coarsely chopped pecans <br> 1 � cups (4 � ounces) coarsely chopped walnuts <br></p> <p>Position racks in the center and top third of the oven and preheat to 350�F. Line two half-sheet pans with parchment paper.</p> <p>Bring 1 inch of water to a simmer in a medium saucepan over low heat. Put the butter in a wide, heatproof bowl, and melt the butter over the hot water in the saucepan. Add the semisweet and unsweetened chocolate, stirring often, until melted and the mixture is smooth. Remove the bowl from the heat and let stand, stirring occasionally, until cooled slightly but still warm, about 5 minutes.</p> <p>Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together into a medium bowl. Whip the eggs in the bowl of a heavy-duty stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment on medium-high speed until the eggs are foamy and lightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Increase the speed to high and gradually add the sugar, then the vanilla. Whip until the eggs are very thick and pale yellow, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium and beat in the tepid chocolate, making sure it is completely incorporated. Change to the paddle attachment and reduce the mixer speed to low. Gradually add the flour mixture. Remove the bowl from the mixer. Using a wooden spoon, stir in the chocolate chips, pecans, and walnuts, making sure the chunky ingredients are evenly distributed at the bottom of the bowl.The dough will be somewhat soft.</p> <p>Using a 2-inch ice-cream scoop, portion the batter onto the prepared pans, placing the cookies about 1 � inches apart. Bake the cookies immediately&#x2014;if you wait, they won&#x2019;t be shiny after baking. Bake, switching the position of the pans from top to bottom and front to back about halfway through baking, until the cookies are set around the edges (if you lift a cookie from the pan, the edges should release easily, even if the center of the cookie seems underdone), 17 to 20 minutes. Do not overbake. Cool completely on the baking pans. (The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature, with the layers separated by parchment paper, for up to 3 days.)</p> <br><b>Sarabeth Levine</b> has earned the James Beard Award for Outstanding Pastry Chef.

His father, a local shoemaker, was once described as &#39;upright...walking in the fear of God, strict in his Secession principles, rugged and strong, in family discipline inexorable&#39;. Duncan&#39;s own spiritual pilgrimage was, however, tortuous and painful. His pathway to faith took him through unbelief and heresy, even although he had offered himself for the work of the Christian ministry. In retrospect his experiences prepared him for the quality of Christian service which later characterized his life and work, most notably as Professor of Hebrew in New College, Edinburgh. A man of brilliant intellect, Duncan is often only known today by the anecdotes which memorialise the eccentricities which marked hs life- as is often true of men of genius. But it is by his spiritual experience he is best remembered. It was deep and all-demanding, and not without its on-going struggles. But through it he came to a grace, understanding and wisdom possessed by few. For that reason alone contemporary Christians can learn much from these reminscences of his life.</p><p></p><h2>Joel Sternfeld: American Prospects</h2><p>Originally published in 1987, Joel Sternfeld's now-classic view of America is here remastered, redesigned and reprinted at a larger, brighter, truer scale. Finally, photography and offset printing techniques have caught up with Sternfeld's eye, and this new edition of <i>American Prospects</i> succeeds in presenting Sternfeld's most seminal work as it has always meant to be shown. A specially-commissioned essay by Kerry Brougher, Chief Curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, considers the historical context in which Sternfeld was working and the pivotal role that <i>American Prospects</i> has played in the course of contemporary filmmaking and art photography. In <i>American Prospects</i>, a fireman shops for a pumpkin while a house burns in the background; a group of motorcyclists stop at the side of the road to take in a stunning, placid view of Bear Lake, Utah; the high-tech world headquarters of the Manville Corporation sits in picturesque Colorado, obscured by a defiant boulder; a lone basketball net stands in the desert near Lake Powell in Arizona; and a cookie-cutter suburban housing settlement rests squarely amongst rolling hills in Pendleton, Oregon. Sternfeld's photographic tour of America is a search for the truth of a country not just as it exists in a particular era but as it is in its ever-evolving essence. It is a sad poem, but also a funny and generous one, recognizing endurance, poignant beauty, and determination within its sometimes tense, often ironic juxtapositions of man and nature, technology and ruin.</p><p>In the late 1970s and early '80s Joel Sternfield criss-crossed the country, from Beverly Hills, Calif., to Aroostook County, Me., capturing Thoreau's lives of quiet desperation whipsawed by the American dream in transition. One of the most powerful images here is of a potato harvest. A bone-weary girl waits on a barrel of potatoes on a gray Maine day. The horizon looms before her, but rather than being limitless it seems as if it means to crush her. "American Prospects," first issued in 1987, is an essential documant in understanding both 20th- and 21st-century America.

This was only one of the discoveries Aid has made during two decades of research in formerly top-secret documents. In <i>The Secret Sentry</i>, Aid provides the first-ever full history of America's largest security apparatus, the National Security Agency. </p><p>This comprehensive account traces the growth of the agency from 1945 to the present through critical moments in its history, from the cold war up to its ongoing involvement in Afghanistan and Iraq. Aid explores the agency's involvement in the Iraqi weapons intelligence disaster, where evidence that NSA officials called "ambiguous" was used as proof of Iraqi WMD capacity, and details the intense debate within the NSA over its unprecedented role, pressed by the Bush-Cheney administration, in spying on U.S. citizens. </p><p>Today, the NSA has become the most important source of intelligence for the U.S. government, providing 60 percent of the president's daily intelligence briefing. While James Bamford's <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Shadow Factory </i>covered the NSA since 9/11, <i>The Secret Sentry </i>contains new information about every period since World War II .

Though his father is distant and his mother is absent, Danny has his beloved sister Maeve: Maeve, with her wall of black hair, her delicacy, her brilliance. Life is comfortable and coherent, played out under the watchful eyes of the house's former owners in the frames of their oil paintings, or under the cover of the draperies around the window seat in Maeve's room.</p><p>Then one day their father brings Andrea home: Andrea, small and neat, a dark hat no bigger than a saucer pinned over a twist of her fair hair. Though they cannot know it, Andrea's advent to the Dutch House sows the seed of the defining loss of Danny and Maeve's lives. Her arrival will exact a banishment: a banishment whose reverberations will echo for the rest of their lives. </p><p>For all that the world is open to him, for all that he can accumulate, for all that life is full, Danny and his sister are drawn back time and again to the place they can never enter, knocking in vain on the locked door of the past. For behind the mystery of their own enforced exile is that of their mother's self-imposed one: an absence more powerful than any presence they have known. </p><p>Told with Ann Patchett's inimitable blend of wit and heartbreak, <i>The Dutch House</i> is a story of family, betrayal, love, responsibility and sacrifice; of the powerful bonds of place and time that magnetize and repel us for our whole lives, and the lives of those who survive us.</p></p><p></p><h2>Darius: Lord of Pleasures</h2><p><p><strong>A story that breaks all the rules...</strong></p><p>Darius is a gripping and remarkable tale of desperation, devotion, and redemption from award-winning <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA Today </em>bestselling author Grace Burrowes.

His veined hands were rock steady, and his tone cordial as he held his glass out to his host. "Just a touch more, perhaps? The wind is bitter, even for November."</p> <p>And Darius Lindsey, veteran of more unnerving moments, stiff beatings, and bad luck than any earl's younger son ought to have endured, took his guest's glass to the sideboard and filled it with another finger of cognac-a scant finger.</p> <p>Lord Longstreet was known as a shrewd politician, capable of quietly negotiating compromises between embattled factions in the Lords. He'd sent around a note asking to make a call privately, after dark, and Darius had accepted out of curiosity.</p> <p>A curiosity he was apparently going to regret at length.</p> <p>Darius crossed his arms and leaned back against the sideboard. "You're repeating rumor, my lord, and slanderous rumor at that. Just what did you come here to say?"</p> <p>"Blunt." Lord Longstreet's faded brown eyes gleamed with humor. "Suppose you've learned to be, and that's all to the good. Excellent libation, by the way, and I notice you aren't keeping up, young man." Longstreet raised his glass with gentlemanly bonhomie, while Darius wanted to smash his drink against the hearthstones-not that he had the coin for even such a small extravagance of temper.</p> <p>"You needn't confirm or deny these rumors," Lord Longstreet went on, shifting a bit in a chair more sturdy and comfortable than elegant. "I have no intention of recalling the information or where I came by it once I leave you tonight."</p> <p>"Gracious of you, when you're repeating the kind of insinuations that can get a man called out."</p> <p>"Involving as they do, the honor of several ladies," Longstreet rejoined. "If one can call them that."</p> <p>Darius didn't rise to the bait. Tonight was not a night when he was expected elsewhere in the wee hours-thank a merciful God-and in deference to his guest's age, Darius had for once built up the fire to the point where his quarters were cozy. This also resulted in more illumination cast on threadbare carpet, scarred furniture, and a water stain high up on the outside wall.</p> <p>"Ah, good." Longstreet's amusement was in evidence again. "You don't rile, and you neither gossip nor disparage the women. This comports with your reputation as well."</p> <p>Darius set his drink aside while foreboding and distaste-for himself, his guest, and this topic-roiled in his gut. "While I am pleased to have your approval for mere gentlemanly reticence, I must ask again if you troubled making my acquaintance only to banter gossip. You are an important man, both politically and socially, while I am the proverbial impoverished second son, making my way as best I can. What errand brings you to my doorstep, my lord?"</p> <p>Longstreet nodded, as if acknowledging that opening arguments were over. "Lady Longstreet-"</p> <p>"No." Darius paced off to the door, wanting to pitch the old man onto the stairs.</p> <p>"I beg your pardon?"</p> <p>"I will not be procured for your wife's entertainment," Darius said, "or for yours, or yours and hers. Finish your drink if you must, and I'll show you out."</p> <p>"I would far rather you heard me out. Had I any other alternative, Lindsey, believe me I would be pursuing it."</p> <p>Darius turned his back to his guest and resisted the urge to slam his fist into the wall. "Despite what you've heard, my lord, there are limits..."</p> <p>"You don't swive them," Longstreet said briskly, as if conceding an otherwise unimpressive mount had good quarters and a sane eye. "You won't, in fact. Which is why you find me here, because any other man-any other young man with a need for coin and the ingenuity to go on as you have-would have taken what was offered and considered it his revenge on the feckless women throwing their money at him."</p> <p>Darius turned a granite stare on his guest, even knowing the man had the ear of the regent. "I find this conversation exceedingly tedious."</p> <p>Longstreet met that stare. "Lindsey, do sit down. Please. I am older than your braying ass of a father, and this is difficult enough without your wounded pride added to the general awkwardness."</p> <p>"Did she put you up to this?" Darius took the other chair-the one that rocked slightly, though it wasn't supposed to-and didn't touch his drink.</p> <p>"She would never do such a thing. Vivian is a lady in every sense of the word."</p> <p>"Though you are procuring for her." Darius said it flatly, as nastily as he could, for this scheme Lord Longstreet was about to propose, it purely, rottenly stank. For all involved.</p> <p>"I have my reasons, and Vivian understands them."</p> <p>For the first time, Longstreet's patrician features showed a flicker of sentiment. Whatever the man's motivations, there was nothing prurient about them, and his lordship was very determined on his goal.</p> <p>"As best I recall, you have two sons, my lord. What need have you of a... gallant for your wife?"</p> <p>Gallant. A euphemism that loomed larger than the stain behind his lordship's head.</p> <p>"Aldous died at Waterloo, and his older brother lost his life on the field of honor this fall." Longstreet ran a hand through thinning sandy-gray hair, then stared at his drink.</p> <p>"I'm sorry."</p> <p>"God, man, so am I," Longstreet replied, shifting his gaze to stare at the cheery blaze Darius really could not afford. "We put it about that Algernon eloped to the Continent, but he lies in the family plot at Longchamps. Some creative tale will be woven when the other fellow's family has recovered a bit, for each of the young fools managed to kill his opponent."</p> <p>Darius pushed aside pity-burying two sons merited pity-and focused on practicalities, something he was good at. "So you seek somebody not only to bed your lady, but also to get her with child? If so, then I am assuredly not your man."</p> <p>"That would be part of the bargain." Longstreet's voice did not betray a hint of shame about this proposition. "Hear my reasons before you make an old man face that bitter wind."</p> <p>A lady's honor was to be compromised, but an old man was to be spared the nippy weather. This was what Darius's life had come to.</p> <p>"Make your words count, my lord. While I am sensible of the dilemma you face, surely there must be cousins or nephews somewhere who can solve the problem by inheritance and spare your lady this unseemly contrivance you contemplate."</p> <p>"There are none. If I die without legitimate male issue, then the entire estate reverts to the Crown."</p> <p>Spare me from titled old men and their petty conceits. "This has happened in many a family, and you will be dead, so what does it matter to you?"</p> <p>Longstreet shifted again in his chair, though Darius suspected that was a seasoned parliamentarian's delaying tactic.</p> <p>"Were it simply a question of my needs, young man, you'd be absolutely right. However, upon close examination, I find the Crown could make a credible argument that there is virtually no personal estate. My wealth is significant, but the Crown's lawyers will twist matters such that none of that wealth is personal, but rather, all attached to the title. The regent would get everything, and Vivian would be literally a charity case."</p> <p>"Your wife has no dower portion?"</p> <p>"None worth the name. I am pained on her behalf to be so honest, but ours was not a romantic match. She needed marrying rather desperately, and I could not abide to see her taken advantage of by those who prey on women in such circumstances. I suppose I needed a bit of marrying too."</p> <p>Darius sipped his drink, angling for time to absorb his guest's words. Usually, a woman desperately in need of marrying had conceived a child desperately in need of legitimacy. Lady Longstreet's difficulty was the absence of children.</p> <p>"I cannot agree to anything without knowing all the facts, Lord Longstreet."</p> <p>His lordship ran a bony finger around the rim of his glass. "Fair enough. Her stepfather would have sold her to any grasping cit with the coin," the older man said wearily. "Vivian deserved better than that. She was my first wife's devoted companion for the duration of Muriel's illness. Vivian and I became friends, of a sort, and when Muriel died, there was Vivian's stepfather, ready to snatch her back and auction her off."</p> <p>"And she wasn't of age, that she couldn't avoid such a fate?" Darius frowned, because this sounded all too much like his sister Leah's circumstances, though the Earl of Wilton himself was the one intent on procuring for his older daughter.</p> <p>"She was not quite twenty-one, so she was not of age in the sense you mean. Then too, Vivian lacks the... animal cunning to thwart her stepfather's schemes. She'd kill a man outright, but never by stabbing him in the back. And as you well know, a woman's lot in life leaves her little enough discretion regarding her choice of mate, particularly a woman raised in Polite Society."</p> <p>Apparently Lord Longstreet was familiar with Leah's circumstances too, which notion brought no comfort. "So you've convinced Lady Longstreet to secure her future by disporting with me," Darius concluded. "How flattering."</p> <p>Longstreet set his drink down with a thump, the first spark of temper he'd exhibited in a quarter hour of fencing. "You should be flattered, by God. Vivian chose you from a set of candidates I selected for her. There were precious few left on the list once I started discreet inquiries, but you were the one she chose."</p> <p>"Am I to know why?"</p> <p>"You can ask her," Longstreet replied, showing the guile of a seasoned politician. "She's a damsel in distress, Lindsey, and you have it in your power to provide her a lifetime of security and to preserve a fine old title from the maw of the regent's bottomless appetite."</p> <p>Darius felt relief as insight struck. "That's what this is about, isn't it? You don't favor Prinny's politics or priorities, and you're loathe to see centuries of Longstreet wealth poured onto his side of the scales."</p> <p>Lord Longstreet's brow knitted. "I wouldn't like that outcome, no."</p> <p>"And even less would you like it known you'd schemed with your wife to avoid it by consorting with the likes of me."</p> <p>"Shrewd." Longstreet blew out a breath. "You must see that as much as you desire my discretion, I need yours. I've worked for nigh fifty years for the good of the realm, Lindsey, and between the lunatic Americans, the equally mad King, and the greedy, mad Corsican, it hasn't been an easy fifty years. If word gets out I sent my wife off to some impoverished younger son, like a mare to the breeding shed, then nobody will recall the votes I won, the bills I drafted, the riots I prevented. I will simply be a greedy, unpatriotic old fool."</p> <p>Darius reluctantly, and silently, admitted that Lord Longstreet's reasoning made a peculiar sort of sense. "You don't mind the old fool part, but the unpatriotic hurts abominably. Again, my lord, I do sympathize, or I would if the nation's fate interested me half as much as my own, but I cannot help you."</p> <p>"You haven't heard the entirety of my proposal, young man." Longstreet held out his glass for a refresher, buying himself a few more minutes. Darius understood the ploy and allowed it only because of the pile of unpaid bills silently mocking him from the corner of his desk.</p> <p>And the other pile in the drawer, aging not half so well as William Longstreet had.</p> <p>"I'm listening," Darius said, foregoing any further drink for himself. "For the present."</p> <p>Longstreet shoved to his feet in a succession of creaky moves: scoot, brace, push, totter, balance, then pace. "First, you and Vivian must spend enough time together that there is a reasonable likelihood of a child. Second, I'd like you sufficiently invested in the child's life that you will not, for any amount of money, divulge the facts of his or her paternity."</p> <p>"If I may," Darius interrupted. "The chances are even any child born would be female, in which case your impoverished viscountess is left to support not only herself, but a girl child, which can be an expensive proposition."</p> <p>Longstreet's gaze turned crafty as he propped himself against the mantel. "That would be the usual case, except my title is very old, and only in my great-grandfather's day was it elevated from a barony to a viscountcy. Nobody has looked at the letters patent in a century, save myself, and while the viscountcy carries a male entail, the barony can be preserved through the female line."</p> <p>"You're sure?"</p> <p>"It's that old. When the Black Death came through, there was pressure on the monarchy to liberalize its patents, as tremendous wealth was reverting when family after family lost its male line. Mine is one of the few surviving more liberally drafted letters, and thus the barony-and the estate wealth-will be preserved regardless of the gender of the child."</p> <p>This scheme was madness-thoroughly researched, carefully considered, potentially lucrative madness. "The barony will survive if there is a child. If I agree to your terms."</p> <p>"Stop putting that bottle up, young man. Having heard this much, I think there are terms you'll agree to, do we apply ourselves to their negotiation in good faith."</p> <p>"Good faith? You're attempting to cheat the Crown, procure the intimate services of a worthless bounder for your lady wife, perpetrate a fraud on your patrimony, and you speak of good faith?"</p> <p>"You're young." Lord Longstreet resumed his seat in another succession of creaks and totters, this time popping a knee joint as well. "You can afford your ideals. Imagine what might befall your family were your father to lose the Wilton title, his lands, his wealth-how might your sisters go on, if not in some version of the oldest and least-respected profession?"</p> <p>Darius leveled a look at him such that Lord Longstreet flushed and glanced away.</p> <p>"So you beat your sisters to it," he surmised. "Your father isn't just a braying ass, Lindsey, he's a disgrace to his kind."</p> <p>"And yet it's his line you'll be grafting onto your own-if I agree."</p> <p>It took two hours, the rest of the cognac, and very likely some of the toughest negotiating Lord Longstreet had seen in half a century, but in the end, Darius agreed.</p> <p>***</p> <p>"William will not be joining us."</p> <p>In addition to lustrous dark hair done up in a prim coronet, Lady Vivian Longstreet had a low voice, a contralto, laced with controlled tension.</p> <p>"I beg your pardon?" Darius succeeded in keeping the irritation from his tone, but only just. This civilized dinner a trois had been one of Lord Longstreet's terms, and Darius had grudgingly acceded to the older man's desire to see his wife politely introduced to her... what? Darius couldn't bring himself to apply the word lover. Stud was too vulgar, if accurate, though worse terms came to mind.</p> <p>"William is under the weather," Lady Longstreet said. "May I take your coat? The servants have been dismissed for the evening, and yes, I truly mean he's feeling poorly. William is capable of dip...</p></p><h2>Hints on Child Training</h2><p>Book by Trumbull, H. Clay</p><p></p><h2>The Sound of Thunder</h2><p>Sean Courtney, the impulsive adventurer of When the Lion Feeds, returns from the wilderness a rich man - but encounters a cruel homecoming. `Only once in his life had Sean met a man whose stength matched his own - and now again they were pitted against each other. He drove the heel of his right hand up under Jan Paulus`s chin, forcing his head back abainst the endircling left arm. It should have broken Jan Paulus`s neck. Instead he locked his arms around Sean`s chest below the level of his armpits - and squeezed. Within seconds Sean felt his face swellign and congesting with blood, his mouth opened and his tongue came out between his teeth.` Sound of Thunder is a vibrant tale of war, and of love and hatred in many forms: between brothers, between friends, between father and son, and between man and woman. Striding through its pages, the commanding figure of Sean Courtney, maturing, deepening, develops from the headstrong adventurer of When the Lion Feeds into a seasoned soldier and leader of men.</p><p>These audiobooks from Macmillan UK offer abridged readings of some of the world�s most popular authors.

Unauthorized genetically engineered species had been spotted, while some people were simply disappearing. None of the locals were talking to the company, so the company sent disabled combat veteran Yanaba Maddock to spy. But a strange thing happened. With her relocation to the arctic planet came a return of Yana's health and strength. And the more she got to know the people of Petaybee, the more determined she became to protect her new home....<br><i>From the Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Major Yanaba Maddock wasn&#39;t much good to the company anymore. With lungs practically destroyed by poison gas in a military debacle, she could barely breathe without coughing, much less do anything the least bit strenuous. But it wasn&#39;t the company&#39;s way to discard those they might still find some use for...and so they retired Yana to the icy planet Petaybee to do their spying. Strange things were happening on Petaybee, it seemed. Unauthorized genetically engineered species had been spotted. Geologic survey teams sent to locate newly detected mineral deposits were either coming up empty - or disappearing altogether. And the locals weren&#39;t talking. In fact, the company had reason to believe that the locals were deliberately hiding something - and perhaps even plotting rebellion. As a combat veteran and a medical retiree due to spend the rest of her days on this arctic world, Yana was the ideal person to get close to the natives. Having already lost her lungs in service to the company, Yana wasn&#39;t much of a mind to freeze to death for it, as well. But she quickly learned that the people of Petaybee were more than willing to adopt a sickly newcomer: they were eager to show her the ropes, introduce her around, teach her how to cook and how to keep warm, and even dose her up on a home remedy that calmed her cough and soothed her ragged lungs like nothing in the company&#39;s state-of-the-art medical kits. As Yana&#39;s strength and health returned, she became more and more determined to protect her new home and her new people from the depredations of a greedy and increasingly desperate company. For something strange and wonderful truly was happening on Petaybee.

To provide the framework of her inquiry, Helen Garner uses the very public case of a University of Melbourne college master accused of sexual harassment by two of his students. After reading about the charge in the newspaper, Garner, a longtime feminist, impulsively wrote a letter of support to the accused man. The letter was made public and in the wake of much criticism over her support of the man, Garner set out to explore the women's claims. Along the way she uncovers issues that challenge her notions of feminism, political activism, gender relations, and power dynamics. With a journalist's eye for detail, Garner leads the reader into a riveting examination of the nature of sex and power in contemporary society.A circuitous, speculative essay about an infamous sexual harassment case at an Australian university. Garner, a novelist, essayist, screenwriter of films directed by Jane Campion and Gillian Armstrong, and occasional journalist for Time Australia, was drawn into her obsession with this case by a 1992 newspaper report: A woman law student filed an indecent assault complaint with local police against the master of Ormond College at Melbourne Univesity. The student alleged that the man had put his hand on her breast while they danced at an end-of-the-school-year social. Garner, a self-described ``feminist pushing fifty,'' impulsively writes to the accused academic, deploring that ``our ideals of so many years [should be] distorted into this ghastly punitiveness.'' She seems surprised that these words come back to haunt her later attempts to probe the case as a journalist and effectively block her constructing a straightforward investigative account. Indeed, her unsuccessful efforts to arrange a single conversation with either of two women students who bring charges against the master is the slender thread on which she hangs her narrative. We follow Garner through a series of awkward interviews, from the hapless master (who is forced from his job, though Garner comes to believe he is innocent) to many others peripherally involved in the case. None of the informants speak to Garner on the record, and her own reliability as an observer is far from clear. She comes across as a self-absorbed woman who is admittedly overinvested in her identity as a rebel and a seeker during the '70s. The mother of a grown daughter, she remains both skeptical of men's ability to negotiate subtle sexual currents and vaguely contemptuous of young women in denial about the power of their own beauty and sexual magnetism. Though not without occasional insights about the inadequacies of the adversarial processes of law in resolving conflicts about sex and power, this is ultimately more frustrating than illuminating to read. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

This isn't a book about hip Buddhism with some kind of bad-ass attitude. This is a training manual for learning Buddhist attitudes that will help readers find greater peace of mind and happiness in daily life. The premise here is mind control the Tibetan Buddhist way. Wallace (<i>Boundless Heart</i>) draws upon the traditional "root text" of the Seven-Point Mind Training and expertly translates the ancient teachings into a Western-flavored lesson. In fact, another possible title for this highly esteemed book might be, Buddhism Taught with a Western Attitude. Rather than rely solely on the traditional teaching methods of using stories and parables to ground Buddhist theory into daily living, Wallace sprinkles in large doses of intellectual and scientific analogies&#x2014;definite crowd-pleasers in the West. For instance, when he delves into two Buddhist approaches for training the mind's attent! ion&#x2014;control and release&#x2014;he uses the ancient metaphor of taming an elephant in the room to heel. But in the next breath he moves into a modern analogy of purifying a polluted river. This slip-sliding ease between the language and sensibilities of ancient and modern worlds is a marvel and delight for any Western student of Buddhism. <p></p> A few caveats: Wallace is not as cozy of a writer as other popular Buddhist teachers of the West, such as Pema Chodron, Jack Kornfield, or Sharon Salzburg. His is more of the Ken Wilbur and Robert Thurman variety&#x2014;fascinated by the keen intelligence behind this ancient religion as well as its big heart and timeless relevance. Think of this as a mind-blowing, attitude-expanding book, rather than a comfy bedside companion. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>B.

Here are the great divas, Pola Negri and Gloria Swanson; the great flappers, Colleen Moore and Clara Bow; the great cowboys, William S. Hart and Tom Mix; and the great lover, John Gilbert. Here, too, is the quintessential slapstick comedienne, Mabel Normand, with her Keystone Kops; the quintessential all-American hero, Douglas Fairbanks; and, of course, the quintessential all-American dog, Rin-Tin-Tin.<br><br>This is the first book to anatomize the major silent players, reconstruct their careers, and give us a sense of what those films, those stars, and that Hollywood were all about. An absolutely essential text for anyone seriously interested in movies, and, with more than three hundred photographs, as much a treat to look at as it is to read.</p><p>Through concise biographies, explorations of filmographies, and captivating still shots, Jeanine Basinger offers remarkable insight into both the on- and offscreen lives of the cinema's first stars. Basinger shows an incredible knack for getting past the average movie fan's barriers to appreciating silent film actors: the larger-than-life acting style, frequently goofy plots, and general difficulty in finding films of all but a few luminaries like Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. Deft plot synopses, careful explanations of the skills needed for silent acting, and a genuine affection for the movies she's describing allow Basinger to give the reader a real sense of why these early actors were so beloved--and why they are so deserving of tribute. Mary Pickford, long unfairly maligned for playing saccharine little girls, is revealed to be a shrewd and highly professional performer, involved in every aspect of film production, careful to expand beyond her audience's expectations of her, and possessing deft comic flair. The lives and careers of two silent cowboys, the soulfully stoic William S. Hart and the flamboyant Tom Mix, are also compared and contrasted--oddly enough, to the detriment of neither. The book also covers the great sex symbols like Pola Negri and Rudolph Valentino and takes a welcome dive into the comedies of Mack Sennett. Equally engaging as browsing material or a cover-to-cover read, <i>Silent Stars</i> gives voice to both the sung and unsung pioneers of film. <i>--Ali Davis</i>7 x 9 1/4&#34; trim. 307 photos.

Her articles and reviews have appeared in Open Spaces, Wild Earth Journal, Birdwatcher&#39;s Digest, and The Prairie Naturalist.<i>Starred Review.</i> When Charles Darwin set out on his voyage of discovery aboard the <i>Beagle </i>in 1831, he was a na�ve naturalist. Upon his return to England five years later, as nature writer Haupt (<i>Rare Encounters with Ordinary Birds</i>) capably demonstrates, he was a polished, philosophical student of nature. In fluid, lovely prose, Haupt documents this dramatic transformation, focusing on the notebooks Darwin kept during the journey. Through her selections, we see Darwin's minute observations and his understanding of the natural world, and we gain early hints of the ideas that would transform the world when he published <i>On the Origin of Species </i>in 1859. While Haupt presents nothing dramatically new, it is enjoyable to picture the young Darwin spending hours watching Andean condors soar and anthropomorphizing many South American birds (not just the famous finches of the Gal�pagos). Haupt uses Darwin's personal journey as a metaphor for our contemporary view of the natural world, expressing the hope that people today might become more attuned to their natural surroundings. Darwin, Haupt argues, reminds us "that we too are animals, connected to life, past and present.... That nothing in the natural world is beneath our notice." <i>(Mar. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Horrible as this is, it has redeeming values, one being its warning against addictive pleasures and too much partying. When down-at-heels screenwriter Tom Prentice identifies his ex-wife Amy in the morgue, she's 50 pounds underweight and mutilated. Then when Prentice pitches a banal cop-show to studio head Arthwright, Arthwright is oddly not dismissive of the dumb idea. As we later find out, Arthwright is a kind of astral vampire. Meanwhile, Reverend Garner, a recovering doper/alcoholic who runs a ministry in Oakland, finds that his teenage daughter Constance is missing. She's been kidnapped by Ephram Pixie, a ghoul with astral ties who turns Constance into a pleasure addict by psychic pressure on her pleasure-center brain cells. Ephram likes to have Constance enjoy sex in his presence while she murders folks in nasty ways in motel rooms. Mitch Teitelbaum, the missing young brother of Tom's roommate Jeff, turns up in a hospital after deliberately laying bare his chest muscles and slitting open his leg, among other enjoyable self-injuries, after a strange party. With echoes of The Shining, this all-continuing party takes place at the fenced-in residence of some ageless Malibu film folk and famed party-givers (including Arthwright) who have been living for decades as vampires of pleasure. Their particular pleasure is to extend their snouts like a mosquito's feeding tube and suck out just enough flesh to leave a victim emaciated but still alive. Some of the party guests are themselves in advanced decay but still actively autoerotic. The story's ghastliest effects focus on the wetbones, or victims now a skinless rubble of fresh bones--bones sometimes strapped together with thongs to make wet furniture....

Shapes: Is that a carrot, or a triangle? Colors: Watch for peppers in every range of the rainbow. Numbers: A zero-to-ten zoo! ABCs: A full produce section of sculptures acts out the alphabet. And Opposites: You've never seen Up/Down and Big/Little like this before! Every time we think Saxton Freymann can do no more with bok choy or broccoli, he astonishes us all over again. And this book is one-stop shopping for all parents' early-childhood education needs. Try some FOOD FOR THOUGHT!</p><p>In the fertile mind of artist/sculptor Saxton Freymann, a cauliflower is a poodle, an artichoke is a wolf, a banana is an octopus, and a pumpkin is just about anything. Fruits and veggies - meticulously carved, then photographed - are his special gift to the bountiful world of children&#39;s literature. &#34;What&#39;s great about food,&#34; he says, &#34;is that it keeps all of the photos fun.&#34; Freymann lives in New York City with his wife and three children, all of whom are very healthy, he says, because they eat the cast of characters he works on. For more information about Saxton Freymann, visit: scholastic.com/tradebooks Born in The Netherlands to artist parents, Joost turned his creative energy to food in 1976, when he became fascinated with the garnishes used by Japanese sushi chefs. The result was Play With Your Food, his first collaboration with Saxton Freymann, and a bestseller for the whole family. Joost believes that if you can open children&#39;s eyes and thinking with things they can understand and duplicate - like food creations - a new range of creativity opens up. &#34;Then,&#34; he says, &#34;you can take them to a museum.&#34;*Starred Review* PreS. Freymann and Elffers previously used their ingenious food sculptures to introduce concepts in <i>How Are You Peeling </i>(1999) and <i>One Lonely Sea Horse </i>(2000). They have truly perfected their craft in this winning collection that covers basic shapes, colors, numbers, letters, and opposites--all introduced through images of artfully manipulated fruits and vegetables. Solid, candy-colored backgrounds showcase an irresistible cast of produce-part creatures, which, thanks to a few inspired cuts, reflect an astonishing assortment of expressions and personalities. The simple, clean design is ideal for demonstrating the concepts; the uncluttered spreads make counting and identification easy. But it's the playful, wonderfully clever transformation of familiar foods that will win an audience; preschoolers will howl gleefully over glistening green-pepper frogs and a snowman of stacked mushroom caps, who toasts his marshmallow over fruit-skin flames. Fans of their previous books will find much that is familiar here, but in this mix of concept and unabashed food play, the authors get the formula just right. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yet if we think about "revolting" in a different way, Kathleen LeBesco argues, we can recognize fatness as not simply an aesthetic state or a medical condition, but a political one. If we think of revolting in terms of overthrowing authority, rebelling, protesting, and rejecting, then corpulence carries a whole new weight as a subversive cultural practice that calls into question received notions about health, beauty, and nature. <br><br><i>Revolting Bodies</i> examines a number of sites of struggle over the cultural meaning of fatness. The book is grounded in scholarship on identity politics, the social construction of beauty, and the subversion of hegemonic medical ideas about the dangers of fatness. It explains how the redefinition of fat identities has been undertaken by people who challenge conventional understandings of nature, health, and beauty and, in so doing, alter their individual and collective relationships to power. <br><br>LeBesco explores how the bearer of a fat body is marked as a failed citizen, inasmuch as her powers as a worker, shopper, and sexually "desirable" subject are called into question. At the same time, she highlights fat fashion, relations among fat, queer, and disability politics and activism, and online communities as opportunities for transforming these pejorative stereotypes of fatness. Her discussion of the long-term ramifications of denying bodily agency&#x2015;in effect, letting biological determinism run rampant&#x2015;has implications not only for our understanding of fatness but also for future political practice.</p><p>A provocative analysis of fatness as a cultural construct.Kathleen LeBesco is assistant professor of communication arts at Marymount Manhattan College.</p><h2>God Sent a Man</h2><p>God Sent A Man is the story of Joseph, who allowed himself to be prepared by God to play a crucial role in the history of Egypt and especially in the development of what became the nation of Israel.&#34;It is in my mind to produce in your mind a profound and unshakable conviction that will alter your whole outlook in life and provide you with a philosophy that will transform your life from a meaningless conglomeration of fortuitous changes into a meaningful and divinely arranged plan.&#34;The story of Joseph, son of Jacob, &#34;constitutes the most fascinating and impressive tale in the literature of humanity.&#34;Men and nations are in Gods hand. . . in everything God works for good with those who love him.&#34;</p><p>An evangelist for many years, Carlyle B.

Stress is the great killer of modern life. Ancient Eastern mind-body techniques can bring us balance and healing. We&#x2019;ve all heard claims like these, and many find them plausible. When it comes to disease and healing, we believe we must look beyond doctors and drugs; we must look within ourselves. Faith, relationships, and attitude matter. But why do we believe such things? From psychoanalysis to the placebo effect to meditation, this vibrant history describes our commitments to mind-body healing as rooted in a patchwork of stories that have allowed people to make new sense of their suffering, express discontent with existing care, and rationalize new treatments and lifestyles. These stories are sometimes supported by science, sometimes quarrel with science, but are all ultimately about much more than just science.</p><p>Anne Harrington, professor and chair of the History of Science Department at Harvard University, is the author of Reenchanted Science and the editor of The Placebo Effect and The Dalai Lama at MIT. She lives in Watertown, Massachusetts.Starred Review. Over the past several years, numerous medical reports have confirmed the connection between a positive mental attitude and good physical health. In this splendid book, Harrington (The Placebo Effect), chair of Harvard's history of science department, demonstrates that the belief in such a connection between mind and body is nothing new. She uses case studies and stories of healings to show how deeply embedded the idea of positive mental health is in the quest for physical health, as well as the ways that contemporary medicine has incorporated a focus on mind-body healing into its black bag. In her highly original analysis of this history from ancient times to the present, she discovers six different narratives about mind-body healing. These include the power of suggestion, the power of positive thinking and broken by modern life. In the body that speaks narrative, for instance, Harrington traces the idea that physical symptoms are the outward expression of the mind's secrets, and that revealing those secrets can heal, whether the revelation takes place in the confession box or on the analyst's couch. Harrington's study offers a first-rate cultural history of an age-old but still much debated topic. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The aim was less to defeat the enemy than to bleed him to death. Verdun&#39;s once fertile terrain is even now the &#34;nearest thing to desert in Europe&#34;. The book is not only a chronicle of the facts of death, it is a study of the men who fought there, and one that shows Verdun to be the key to an understanding of World War I. It also investigates the minds of those who waged it, the traditions that bound them, and the world that gave them the opportunity.</p><p>One of Britain&#x2019;s greatest historians, Sir Alistair Horne, CBE, is the author of several famous books on French history as well as a two-volume life of Harold Macmillan.No other campaign, save for that of the Somme, epitomizes the "meat grinder" character of the Western Front in WWI than Verdun.

Specially-commissioned, full-colour photographs bring to life the variety of the canine community. In these pages, you will find not only familiar breeds such as the Labrador Retriever and Yorkshire Terrier, but also rarities such as the Corded Poodle and the Prazsky Krysavik (the world&#39;s smallest dog), as well as new breeds like the Labradoodle and the Cockerpoo. Each portrait is accompanied by an authoritative &#34;biography&#34; of the breed, including its place of origin, historical development, main physical features, and temperament. From how dogs evolved from wolves, through the story of their domestication by early humans, to their roles today as comforting friends, workers, and companions in sports, Bruce Fogle illuminates why dogs have achieved their place of honour in the human community. He traces the special position of canines in human history, as well as presenting essential practical information on selecting and caring for a dog. His thorough discussions of canine anatomy (enhanced with diagrams and photographs), behaviour, and psychology offer insights into dog&#39;s learning patterns, their &#34;self-images&#34;, and their varied styles of communication.</p><p>There are few activities more utterly appealing and delightful to the avid dog fan than ogling a glossy, picture-filled dog encyclopedia. Perhaps you're a dog owner wannabe, reading up on your options in case your parents or landlord or spouse were to suddenly give the go-ahead. Or maybe you already have a dog and want to revel in every word devoted to her breed. Or you're the kind of dogophile that takes pleasure in everything dog-related, and a coffee-table book devoted to dogs is just the ticket to soothe your nerves after a hard day.<p> More than 400 breeds are profiled here, including far more international varieties than many a dog-breed book. Alongside the oft-seen German Shepherds and Great Danes, you'll find profiles of Pudelpointers and Groenendaels, Portuguese Watchdogs and Karabashes, Tibetan Mastiffs and Danish Chicken Dogs. And while the profiles are short--generally a half to a full page of pictures and text--each is accompanied by a series of icons that indicate important traits, such as whether or not the breed tends to be good with children, suitable for urban living, or good watchdogs, and whether it requires a lot of exercise or grooming, gets on well with other dogs, and is easy to obedience train.</p><p> "Domestic Dog Breeds," however, is but one chapter among six. The encyclopedia tracks the evolution of the dog, and does a beautiful job of explaining and illustrating the dog's body and systems, from skeleton and musculature to organs and coat variations. There's a worthwhile chapter on canine society and psychology that covers courtship and mating as well as integral concepts such as the dog pack, aggression, and affection. The encyclopedia also traces people's interest in dogs, from early domestication through folklore, film, art, and advertising to dogs in sports, in work, and as companions. And finally, there's a chapter on how to care for a dog, with advice on choosing a dog, nutrition, grooming, and behavioral problems.</p><p> In short, Fogle's encyclopedia is a fine book for dog owners to rely on and a beautiful book for soon-to-be dog owners to dream on. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p>Bruce Fogle, DVM is a well-known expert on animal behavior.

They are involved in environmental and eco-peace projects.</p><p>"David's grandfather is a sofer, a scribe who carefully, painstakingly, and lovingly letters Torah scrolls for Jewish communities to learn from, live by, and treasure. He teaches his craft to David who, in turn, teaches it to his own children and grandchildren so that the valued traditions can live on through the generations. Damaged Torah scrolls, treasures in their own right but unusable in their imperfect states, find their way over the years into the hands of these dedicated sofrim. The scrolls have been rescued from the Holocaust or from a synagogue fire or from a devastating hurricane by caring, loving, courageous Jews who understand the need for preserving these links to the world of their ancestors. David thinks about restoring them but there is so much damage to each that he is not sure that such a major project would result in success. Then his granddaughter, who has learned about recycling, has an idea. Why not take the undamaged sections of each Torah and see if they can be put together into a useable whole - a patchwork Torah with its own unique beauty, combining so many pieces of the past to be used joyfully onward into the future. This beautifully conceived and written book encompasses so much: tradition, care for the earth, the Holocaust, Hurricane Katrina, relationships through the generations . . . It doesn't seem as if all the elements can possible fit into one coherent story. And yet the author pulls all the pieces together into an innovative and unique whole; it's a patchwork story, somewhat like a patchwork quilt or a patchwork Torah&#x2015;and isn't patchwork art often the most beautiful kind of all? <strong>Soft color paintings with beautifully rendered facial expressions enhance the artistry of the whole; idea, text, and illustrations perfectly merge into a special reading experience</strong>." -- <em>AJL Reviews</em> </p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"<strong>This book will be read more than once, and that seems only appropriate, as Jews are never finished reading the Torah. </strong><br> <br> In a traditional synagogue, the congregation spends an entire year reading the Hebrew Bible out loud, immediately flipping back to the first chapter to start again. So it makes a sort of sense that David&#x2019;s family has spent many generations creating the same Torah scroll out of disparate parts. One part has been hidden during World War II and needs repair. Other sections of the parchment are damaged in a fire and in Hurricane Katrina. David&#x2019;s grandfather was a scribe&#x2015;a sofer&#x2015;and David learns from him, splicing pieces of the damaged scrolls together as an adult to make a new one. 'This is a very unusual scroll,' David tells the congregation. 'I wrote part of it. Other sofers, in other places and at other times, wrote other parts.' Even less-than-traditional Jews may be moved as the scroll is passed from one family member to another. David teaches his grandchildren to write Hebrew letters and reads the first lines of the scroll to his granddaughter: 'In the beginning....' Even the most trivial sentences in the book start to seem oddly beautiful. A passage about scrap drives becomes profound: Nothing is ever lost or wasted; nothing&#x2015;and no one&#x2015;is ever unimportant. <br> <br> <strong>Readers may close the cover thinking that a picture book&#x2015;like a Torah scroll&#x2015;can be essential.</strong> (Picture book. 5-9)" -- <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"In the tradition of the much beloved book, <em>The Keeping Quilt</em> by Patricia Polacco, <em>The Patchwork Torah</em> teaches us how Jews connect across time and place. During the Holocaust, David's grandfather, a sofer (scribe), saves damaged Torah scrolls to repair 'someday maybe.' As David grows and becomes a sofer too, he also holds on to damaged Torahs. His granddaughter asks why there are unused scrolls in his closet and she suggests that he put the undamaged parts of each together to make a 'patchwork Torah.' <br> <br> <strong>Through its serene, oil-painted illustrations and warm language, <em>The Patchwork Torah</em> demonstrates the importance of cycles in Judaism - the cycle of the reading of the Torah ending and beginning on the holiday of Simchat Torah, the cycle of the genera�tions and re-cycling.</strong> It also takes readers on a quick trip across the twentieth century in American Jewish life, from scrap drives to the fight against Hitler to welcoming refugees to Hurricane Katrina. <br> <br> Recommended for ages 7&#x2013;11 with Holo�caust references." -- <em>Jewish Book World</em></p> (<i>Magazine</i>)<br><br><p>"Inspired by tradition, deep faith, and an understanding that to 'repair and reuse things' makes the world a better place, a sofer (the Hebrew word for a craftsman-scribe who transcribes sacred documents) takes pieces of four damaged Torah scrolls&#x2015;ravaged by old age, the Holocaust, fire, and Hurricane Katrina&#x2015;and creates a wonderful new Torah. Although Ofanansky's (Harvest of Light) prose and Oriol's acrylic and gouache vignettes strike a thoughtful, serious mood (as befits a story about an intensely spiritual labor of love), an unmistakable momentum and sense of suspense build as one by one the stories of the rescued Torahs are told, and the scrolls are put into a special cabinet for a yet-to-be-determined future. David, the hero, starts out as boy learning the art of the sofer from his grandfather during World War II, and ends as a grandfather himself in a joyous present-day Simchat Torah celebration, carrying his patchwork Torah as his young granddaughter 'walked proudly alongside him.' <strong>Surprisingly inventive and genuinely uplifting, this story beautifully and subtly ties together two key Jewish precepts: l'dor v'dor (generation to generation) and tikkum olam (repair the world). </strong>Ages 4-8.

In The Reversal (2010), his last Mickey Haller novel, starring the L.A. lawyer who prefers to work out of his Lincoln Town Car, Connelly offered a tour de force of plotting on multiple levels. Here, he narrows the focus considerably, concentrating almost exclusively on what happens inside the courtroom but bringing to the traditional give-and-take of prosecutor, defender, judge, and jury an altogether more complex commingling of personality and legal strategy than is typically on view in legal thrillers. He accomplishes this with a particularly rich first-person narration in which Haller takes us through the courtroom drama as it happens, noting his blunders and praising himself for quick-thinking improvisations. It doesn't hurt, either, that the plot is meaty: a woman whom Haller was representing in a suit against the bank attempting to foreclose on her mortgage is accused of killing the bank official in charge of foreclosures. Combining ripped-from-the-headlines information on the mortgage crisis with a cast of characters that defies stereotypes at every turn of the plot, Connelly shows once again that he will never simply ride the wave of past success. And, neither, apparently, will Mickey Haller, as he reveals a shocking change of direction in the novel's final pages. </p> <p>HIGH-DEMAND BACKSTORY: Connelly's latest Mickey Haller novel will benefit from the release in March of a movie version of The Lincoln Lawyer, the first Haller novel, starring Matthew McConaughey. 750,000 first printing. --Bill Ott</p></p><h2>MacArthur&#39;s ULTRA: Codebreaking and the War against Japan, 1942-1945 (Modern War Studies)</h2><p>Cracking the enemy's radio code is a task so urgent and so difficult that it demands the military's best minds and most sophisticated technology. But when the coded messages are in a language as complex as Japanese, decoding problems multiply dramatically.<br><br>It took the U.S. Army a full two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor to break the codes of the Japanese Imperial Army. But by 1944 the U.S. was decoding more than 20,000 messages a month filled with information about enemy movements, strategy, fortifications, troop strengths, and supply convoys.<br><br>In <i>MacArthur's ULTRA</i>, historian Edward Drea recounts the story behind the Army's painstaking decryption operation and its dramatic breakthrough. He demonstrates how ULTRA (intelligence from decrypted Japanese radio communications) shaped MacArthur's operations in New Guinea and the Philippines and its effect on the outcome of World War II.<br><br>From sources on both sides of the Pacific and national security agency declassified records, Drea has compiled a detailed listing of the ULTRA intelligence available to MacArthur. By correlating the existing intelligence with MacArthur's operational decisions, Drea shows how MacArthur usedand misusedintelligence information. He tells for the first time the story behind MacArthur's bold leap to Hollandia in 1944 and shows how ULTRA revealed the massive Japanese mobilization for what might have been (had it occurred) the bloodiest and most protracted engagement of the entire war the Allied invasion of Japan. Drea also clarifies the role of ULTRA in Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan in 1945, and concludes that ULTRA shortened the war by six to ten months.</p><p>In this book, the author assesses the relationship between special intelligence and the campaigns of General Douglas MacArthur in the Pacific. During World War II, special intelligence, commonly referred to as ULTRA today, meant information obtained through monitoring, intercepting, and decoding enemy radio communications.Edward J.

He so ugly, blind men go the other way!...He not only looks bad! You can smell him in another country!" He held his nose. "Mat will the People in Manila think? We can't have a gorilla for a champ. They're gonna think, lookin' at him, that all black brothers are animals. Ignorant. Stupid. Ugly. If he's champ again, other nations will laugh at us."</p><p>Joe turned and gunned a hole in the thin wood of the wall, then flipped over his desk. "Eddie, listen up! Whatever you do, whatever happens, don't stop the fight! We got nowhere to go after this. I'm gonna eat this half-breed's heart right out of his chest!...I mean it...This is the end of him or me."</p></em><p>When Muhammad Ali met Joe Frazier in Manila for the third, bloody act of their heroic trilogy of fights, the rivalry had spun out of control. More than a clash of personalities or fighting styles, the Ali-Frazier matchup had become a kind of madness, inflamed by the media and the politics of race. When the "Thrilla in Manila" was over, the hype no longer mattered: one man was left with a ruin of a life; the other was battered to his soul.</p><p>Mark Kram's riveting book begins with the boxers themselves -- who they are and who they were. Interweaving present and past, and told in a voice as powerful as a heavyweight punch, Kram explodes the hagiography surrounding both fighters-particularly Ali. While giving Ali his due as arguably the best fighter of all time, Kram paints a much darker and nuanced version of the legend than anyone has ever dared. <em>Ghosts of Manila</em> is a masterpiece of literary journalism that is sure to take its place alongside A. J. Liebling's <em>The Sweet Science.</em></p><p><em>Ghosts of Manila</em> is a psychologically riveting study of two heroes, many myths, and the reality behind it all.</p></p><p>Muhammad Ali once admitted to former <i>Sports Illustrated</i> writer Mark Kram that he and Joe Frazier went to Manila for the third of their three epic fights "as champions and we came back as old men." Boxing is a particularly unforgiving sport for old men, especially those--as Kram tells us in <i>Ghosts of Manila</i>, his thoroughly riveting account of one of the Sweet Science's greatest rivalries--"with too much pride, heart, and unexamined confidence for their own well-being." Which defines Ali and Frazier's essential characters in a nutshell.<p> Kram begins his saga in the present, looking at the different kinds of isolation that currently surround each man's life, then dances back and forth through time to spar with just who these warriors have been and how they came to be the icons, for better or worse, they became. <i>Ghosts of Manila</i> is more than a twin biography, though; it is an often haunting meditation on how much we project onto our athletes, and how destructive the projections can be. As much as any punishment sustained in three of the most brutal title fights in heavyweight history, the baggage--personal and societal--that Ali and Frazier carried into and out of the ring changed them physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Did Ali earn all the love? Did Frazier deserve all the scorn? To answer the questions, Kram bravely goes toe to toe with Ali worship and Ali's myth. His daring rewards us with knockout profiles of two legends more complex and real than mere iconography might allow. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p><p><strong>Mark Kram, Jr</strong>. won the 2013 PEN/ESPN Award for Literary Sports Writing for his first book, <em>Like Any Normal Day: A Story of Devotion. </em>Articles by him have appeared in <em>The Best American Sports Writing</em> and will be included in the forthcoming anthology, <em>The Great American Sports Page. </em>The Society of Professional Journalists honored him with the 2011 Sigma Delta Chi Award for feature writing.

A tireless defender of women&#39;s rights, especially the rights of those who have been raped and assaulted, and a relentless critic of pornography, Dworkin is one of feminism&#39;s most rigorous minds and fiercest crusaders.Now, in Heartbreak, Dworkin reveals for the first time the personal side of her lifelong journey as activist and writer. By turns wry, spirited, and poignant, Dworkin tells the story of how she evolved from a childhood lover of music and books into a college activist, embraced her role as an international advocate for women, and emerged as a maverick thinker at odds with both the liberal left and the mainstream women&#39;s movement. Throughout, she displays a writer&#39;s genius for expressing emotional truth and an intellectual&#39;s gift for conveying the excitement of ideas and words. Beautifully written and surprisingly intimate, Heartbreak is a portrait of a soul, and a mind, in the making.From Hearthbreak:&#34;How did I become who I am? I have a heart easily hurt. I believed that cruelty was most often caused by ignorance. I thought that if everybody knew, everything would be different. I was a silly child who believed in the revolution. I was torn to pieces by segregation and Viet Nam. Apartheid broke my heart. Apartheid in Saudi Arabia still breaks my heart-I don&#39;t understand why every story about rising oil prices does not come with an addendum about the domestic imprisonment of women in the Gulf states. I can&#39;t be bought or intimidated because I&#39;m cut down in the middle. I walk with women whispering in my ears. Every time I cry there&#39;s a name attached to each tear.&#34;</p><p>Andrea Dworkin is one of the most controversial and influential feminist thinkers of our day. She has spoken at colleges, universities, and _rallies all over the world and is the co-author (with Catharine A. MacKinnon) of civil-rights legislation recognizing pornography as legally actionable sex discrimination. She is the author of thirteen books, including <i>Pornography</i>, <i>Intercourse</i>, and, most recently, <i>Scapegoat</i>. She lives in New York City.In this roughly chronological account of her political formation, Dworkin, a prolific writer and ardent antipornography activist, shares the moments her "memory insists on," things "it will not let go." Thus, from grade school through college (what she calls "the archetypical brothel"), there are sexually predatory teachers, morally bankrupt intellectuals and plenty of molested and "incested" victims. The moral compass of these anecdotes can be dizzying. Dworkin's pedophilic high school teacher running a "menage a quatre" with a couple of her girlfriends was "the snake" offering worldly knowledge; she was his "little Eva" going along with his games. Yet there's no restraining the venom when it comes to an overly prim junior high English teacher who had the nerve to try to comfort her when she was mad about getting a B: "I knew I'd get her someday and this is it: eat shit, bitch." Her college years yielded a few political insurrection anecdotes, followed by some European travel stories, but the narrative segues increasingly into discussions of rape and other forms of violence against women. Jail's too good for most rapists and batterers; she'd have their victims shoot them dead. When "pedophile" Allen Ginsberg fretted about being sent to jail after the Supreme Court upheld the criminalization of child porn, she wished him dead, too. She ends with a long-winded lament of "the worst immoralit[ies]" mostly concerning selling out one's principles, giving up and pretending not to see injustices which all boil down to "a single sin of human nothingness and stupidity." "I don't care about being understood," Dworkin concludes, but not being understood may be the least ofher problems here. Agent, Elaine Markson. (Mar. 1)Forecast:This memoir covers little new ground, but at least it's much shorter than Dworkin's previous works. This and the book's timing (its publication coincides with Women's History Month) may entice readers.<p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth</h2><p><p>In this essay on man Mr. Fuller expresses what may well be his penultimate view of the human condition.

The slim volume proves both mesmerizing and moving, and the use of the present tense lends an air of innocence and mystery to the story, while the book's emotional undercurrents and passions stir up deeper, troubling responses. <i>Jacob's Hands</i> is a complex, disquieting modern fairy tale unlike anything else by either author, and a fascinating artifact of their Hollywood careers. <i>--Michael Bronski</i>Aldous Huxley is the author of several classics, including <i>Brave New World</i> and <i>Chrome Yellow</i>.

Is it ever justifiable for Christians to retaliate in the face of evil? Philosopher Robert Brimlow struggles with these questions in <i>What about Hitler?</i> The author skillfully integrates meditations on scriptural passages, personal reflections on his own challenges to live nonviolently, and a hard-hitting philosophical examination of pacifism and just-war doctrine. <br><br>Both Christian pacifists and defenders of just-war theory will appreciate this book. In addition, <i>What about Hitler?</i> will appeal to those interested in Christian ethics and discipleship, including students, pastors, and laity.</p><p><i>What about Hitler?</i> is part of the The Christian Practice of Everyday Life series, dedicated to theological consideration of the concerns for everyday life. Series editors are David S. Cunningham and William T. Cavanaugh.<p>"With clarity and respect for the best arguments justifying violence, from Augustine and Bonhoeffer to Michael Walzer and Jean Bethke Elshtain, Robert Brimlow responds to the challenges of radical evil. Brimlow provocatively engages the reader on three levels: a philosophical analysis and critique of just war reasoning; meditations on the gospel and Jesus that support willingness to die rather than participating in violence as the 'answer' to Hitler; and the spiritual practices of prayer and daily acts of mercy that habituate persons to being the people of God."--Duane K. Friesen, coeditor of <i>At Peace and Unafraid</i></p><p>"A searching examination of just war and pacifist approaches to war and violence that leads to advice on discipleship. It is a book I would make required reading for a course on the morality of war, even though I don't always agree."--Arthur F. Holmes, editor of <i>War and Christian Ethics</i></p><p>"This is not an easy book to read, which is why Brimlow's book is so important. The hard clarity of his prose witnesses his refusal to report any easy answer to the question posed in the title. As a result, however, he has answered that question in the only honest way it can be answered."--Stanley Hauerwas, Duke Divinity School</p><p>"This book is an honest examination of the most important challenge to pacifism: Would it not be right to use violence to stop great evil, such as that unleashed on the world by Hitler? Brimlow's honesty in dealing with the commands of Jesus is refreshing, and he does not shrink from confronting the dilemma of being a pacifist in a 'supreme emergency' of demonic evil unleashed on society. His answers are profound in their simplicity and honesty."--Craig A. Carter, author of <i>The Politics of the Cross</i></p><p>"I expected, in this book, to see challenges issued to the just war theory. I was also not surprised to see probing questions--drawn creatively from Bonhoeffer and Orwell--posed to pacifists. However, I was not prepared to be so powerfully challenged by the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Michael Allen explores the rigorous lives of professional boatmen who plied non-steam vessels&#x2015;flatboats, keelboats, and rafts&#x2015;on the Ohio and lower Mississippi rivers from 1763-1861.</p><p>Allen first considers the mythical &#x201c;half horse, half alligator&#x201d; boatmen who were an integral part of the folklore of the time. Americans of the Jacksonian and pre-Civil War period perceived the rivermen as hard-drinking, straight-shooting adventurers on the frontier. Their notions were reinforced by romanticized portrayals of the boatmen in songs, paintings, newspaper humor, and literature. Allen contends that these mythical depictions of the boatmen were a reflection of the yearnings of an industrializing people for what they thought to be a simpler time.</p><p>Allen demonstrates, however, that the actual lives of the rivermen little resembled their portrayals in popular culture. Drawing on more than eighty firsthand accounts&#x2015;ranging from a short letter to a four-volume memoir&#x2015;he provides a rounded view of the boatmen that reveals the lonely, dangerous nature of their profession. He also discusses the social and economic aspects of their lives, such as their cargoes, the river towns they visited, and the impact on their lives of the steamboat and advancing civilization.</p><p>Allen&#x2019;s comprehensive, highly informative study sheds new light on a group of men who played an important role in the development of the trans-Appalachian West and the ways in which their lives were transformed into one of the enduring themes of American folk culture.</p></p><p><p>Michael Allen, assistant professor of history at the University of Washington at Tacoma, worked for three years as a towboat deckhand and cook on the upper and lower Mississippi, Illinois, St. Croix, Ouachita, and Arkansas rivers.</p></p><h2>Old World Murder (A Chloe Ellefson Mystery, 1)</h2><p><p>Trying to leave painful memories behind her, Chloe Ellefson is making a fresh start.

Fly fishers have always considered themselves the aristocracy of the sport, and a small number of those devotees, a few thousand at most, insist upon using one device in the pursuit of their obsession: a handcrafted split-bamboo fly rod. Meeting this demand for perfection are the inheritors of a splendid art, one that reveres tradition while flouting obvious economic sense and reaches back through time to touch the hands of such figures as Theodore Roosevelt and Henry David Thoreau.<br><br>In <i>Casting a Spell</i>, George Black introduces readers to rapt artisans and the ultimate talismans of their uncompromising fascination: handmade bamboo fly rods. But this narrative is more than a story of obscure objects of desire. It opens a new vista onto a century and a half of modern American cultural history. With bold strokes and deft touches, Black explains how the ingenuity of craftsmen created a singular implement of leisure&#x2013;and how geopolitics, economics, technology, and outrageous twists of fortune have all come to focus on the exquisitely crafted bamboo rod. We discover that the pastime of fly-fishing intersects with a mind-boggling variety of cultural trends, including conspicuous consumption, environmentalism, industrialization, and even cold war diplomacy. <br><br>Black takes us around the world, from the hidden trout streams of western Maine to a remote valley in Guangdong Province, China, where grows the singular species of bamboo known as tea stick&#x2013;the very stuff of a superior fly rod. He introduces us to the men who created the tools and techniques for crafting exceptional rods and those who continue to carry the torch in the pursuit of the sublime. Never far from the surface are such overarching themes as the tension between mass production and individual excellence, and the evolving ways American society has defined, experienced, and expressed its relationship to the land.<br><br>Fly-fishing may seem a rarefied pursuit, and making fly rods might be a quixotic occupation, but this rich, fascinating narrative exposes the soul of an authentic part of America, and the great significance of little things. George Black&#x2019;s latest expedition into a hidden corner of our culture is an utterly enchanting, illuminating, and enlightening experience.</p><p>George Black did not pick up a fly rod till after his fortieth birthday&#x2013;and he has seldom willingly put one down since. He was born in the small Scottish mining town of Cowdenbeath and was educated at Oxford University. Black is the author of four other books, including <i>The Trout Pool Paradox: The American Lives of Three Rivers</i>. A journalist and editor for more than twenty-five years, he has written for <i>The New York Times</i>, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The New Statesman</i>, <i>Mother Jones</i>, <i>The National Law Journal</i>, <i>Fly Fisherman</i>, and many other publications. He lives in New York City with his wife, the author and playwright Anne Nelson, and their two children.Chapter 1<br>Wilderness with all the Comforts<br><br>My wife&#x2019;s hometown, Stillwater, Oklahoma&#x2014;population forty<br>thousand, home of the Oklahoma State University Cowboys and<br>the National Wrestling Hall of Fame&#x2014;is not the kind of place, at<br>first blush, where you would expect a fly fisherman to have a lifechanging<br>experience. The old downtown is much like the core of a<br>lot of American towns whose original logic has been bypassed by<br>time and Wal-Mart. There are a few bars that cater to the student<br>clientele from OSU, a couple of banks, an upscale home-furnishing<br>franchise, a Christian bookstore or two, an ersatz Starbucks, some<br>boarded-up storefronts, and a multidealer antiques mall, the kind<br>you see these days in almost every town of comparable size.<br>The mall is much as you&#x2019;d expect. Knickknacks and collectibles<br>of all sorts. The stuff Grandma left in her attic. Used books. Farm<br>tools, costume jewelry, fifty-cent ties, incomplete sets of glassware.<br>A room full of ticking wall clocks. Barbie dolls and <i>Star Wars </i>action<br>figures, as the cutoff line for the term &#x201c;antique&#x201d; creeps<br>steadily forward. And then a dealer&#x2019;s stand I&#x2019;d never noticed before:<br>vintage fishing tackle.<br>At this point I&#x2019;d been fly-fishing for three or four years, I suppose&#x2014;<br>long enough to graduate to my first hundred-dollar graphite<br>fly rod and make the transition (in my own mind, at least) from<br>rank beginner to semicompetent amateur&#x2014;by which I mean that<br>once in a while I even caught a few trout. So I stopped to take a<br>look.<br>In one corner of the booth was a narrow wooden box about<br>three feet long, its hinged lid secured with two brass clasps. I<br>popped them open. Inside, boxwood partitions divided the con-<br>tainer into several compartments, on much the same principle as a<br>case of wine. Seven sections of hexagonal bamboo were nestled<br>into the notched dividers. The handle was reversible. There was a<br>stout butt section, two midsections, and three tips of varying<br>thicknesses. This meant you could configure the rod a couple of<br>different ways, as either an eight-foot fly rod or a five-and-a-halffoot<br>bait caster&#x2014;a kind of rod that is used for throwing heavier<br>lures. This struck me as a neat arrangement.<br>Each segment of the rod was coated in a deep cherry red lacquer.<br>The ferrules&#x2014;the male and female parts that connected the<br>sections&#x2014;gleamed as chrome-bright as the trim on an old Cadillac.<br>The snake-shaped line guides were attached to the bamboo<br>with silk thread windings in elaborate patterns of lime green and<br>lemon yellow. The guides themselves were of some gold-colored<br>alloy. An inch or two above the cork grip, a lozenge-shaped acetate<br>decal depicted a snowcapped mountain, perhaps a volcano, against<br>a blue sky, with the initials &#x201c;NFT.&#x201d; You could be forgiven for calling<br>the whole thing gaudy, but to me it was magically redolent of<br>the 1940s, a decade for which I&#x2019;ve always felt a special affinity, perhaps<br>because I was born at its tail end.<br>Suffice it to say that I fell in love with this fly rod, even though<br>it would end up jilting me. The price tag said $87.50. I paid cash.<br>I fished the rod a couple of times that spring. Once I took it out<br>on a smooth-flowing chalk stream in the south of England, where<br>it landed a handsome sixteen-inch rainbow trout. After that I used<br>it to catch some wild brook trout in Connecticut.<br>Feeling quite pleased with myself, I took the rod into a local fly<br>shop to get the reading of an expert. He took the pieces from the<br>box, sighted along each section in turn, put them together,<br>squinted at them some more, made small humphing noises to<br>himself, then gave me a long, appraising look. &#x201c;Well, it&#x2019;s very<br>pretty, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The lacquer&#x2019;s nice, very decorative.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But?&#x201d; I said, knowing from his tone that the real verdict was<br>still to come.<br>&#x201c;Well, of course, as a fly rod it&#x2019;s worthless, it&#x2019;s a piece of junk.&#x201d;<br>He pointed to the volcano decal. &#x201c;NFT&#x2014;Nippon Fishing Tackle.<br>That&#x2019;s Mount Fuji in the picture, I guess. They churned these<br>things out by the thousands in Japan after World War Two, for<br>G.I.&#x2019;s to take home as souvenirs, mainly. It&#x2019;s not even the right kind<br>of bamboo. . . .&#x201d;<br>The man in the fly shop went on talking some more. I missed<br>most of it&#x2014;no doubt because embarrassment had kicked in. But<br>I do remember the gleam in his eye, the lyricism in his voice,<br>and the gist of what he said. The right kind of bamboo, he told<br>me, was something called Tonkin cane. The raw material was<br>Chinese, but the art of transforming it into a fly rod was a peculiarly<br>American accomplishment; and in the hands of a master<br>craftsman . . . well, if I ever had the good fortune to experience<br>the real thing&#x2014;as opposed to the piece of junk I had just<br>dumped on his counter&#x2014;I would surely agree that it was a kind<br>of perfection.<br>I resolved then and there that I would go in search of this peculiarly<br>American vision of perfection, never suspecting that it<br>would take me all the way back to Henry David Thoreau.<br>In July 1857, Thoreau set out on his third journey from Walden<br>Pond to the Maine woods. He&#x2019;d traveled there for the first time in<br>1846, to Bangor by railroad and steamship and thence up the West<br>Branch of the Penobscot River to Mount Katahdin, the second<br>highest peak in New England. His second trip, in 1853, had taken<br>him via Moosehead to Chesuncook Lake. But it seems to have been<br>a little anticlimactic after the ascent of Katahdin, which had inspired<br>his celebrated meditation on raw nature as<br><i>something savage and awful, though beautiful. . . . Here was<br>no man&#x2019;s garden, but the unhandselled globe. It was not lawn,<br>nor pasture, nor mead, nor woodland, nor lea, nor arable, nor<br>waste-land. It was the fresh and natural surface of the planet<br>Earth, as it was made for ever and ever.<br></i>Thoreau and his companions dined on Maine brook trout,<br>freshly caught. &#x201c;In the night,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;I dreamed of trout fishing;<br>when at length I awoke, it seemed a fabled myth this painted<br>fish swam there, so near by couch, and rose to our hooks the last<br>evening, and I doubted if I had not dreamed it all.&#x201d;<br>There was something restless and improvised about Thoreau&#x2019;s<br>third trip to Maine, and he was debating his itinerary right up to<br>the last minute. At first he considered exploring the Saint John<br>River from its source to its mouth, but then he changed his mind,<br>opting instead for Moosehead, the lakes of the Saint John, and the<br>Penobscot again. Just nine days before he left Concord, he was still<br>casting around for a traveling companion. He wrote to his cousin<br>George Thatcher, of Bangor, asking for suggestions. Perhaps his<br>nephew Charles would agree to join him, since he had &#x201c;some<br>fresh, as well as salt, water experience?&#x201d; But in the end, Thoreau<br>settled on his Concord neighbor Edward Hoar, late of California.<br>The interesting thing about Thoreau&#x2019;s account of this third<br>journey is that Hoar&#x2014;his companion for 60 miles by stagecoach,<br>another 265 by canoe, and twelve rough nights under canvas&#x2014;is<br>virtually invisible, never once mentioned by name. From Thoreau&#x2019;s<br>subsequent correspondence, you can infer that his neighbor was a<br>bit of a pain. Two weeks after his return to Concord, Thoreau<br>wrote to a friend that Hoar had &#x201c;suffered considerably from being<br>obliged to carry unusual loads over wet and rough &#x2018;carries.&#x2019; &#x201d; Hoar<br>came back from Bangor with a set of moose antlers, a gift from<br>George Thatcher, which he used as a hat stand, and that&#x2019;s the last<br>we hear of him.<br>In contrast, another character, with whom Thoreau had only<br>the briefest of encounters, positively leaps from the page. It was<br>July 23, and Thoreau, Hoar, and their Penobscot Indian guide, Joe<br>Polis, had just boarded the stage that would take them from Bangor<br>to the remote outpost of Greenville, which lies at the foot of<br>Moosehead Lake.<br>Given the number of guns on display in the coach, Thoreau<br>wrote, &#x201c;you would have thought that we were prepared to run the<br>gauntlet of a band of robbers.&#x201d; But it turned out that the occupants<br>were the members of a hunting party who were embarking<br>on a six-week trip to the Restigouche River and Chaleur Bay, in<br>the remotest reaches of the Canadian province of New Brunswick.<br><i>Their leader was a handsome man about thirty years old, of<br>good height, but not apparently robust, of gentlemanly address<br>and faultless toilet; such a one as you might expect to<br>meet on Broadway. In fact, in the popular sense of the word,<br>he was the most &#x201c;gentlemanly&#x201d; appearing man in the stage,<br>or that we saw on the road. He had a fair white complexion,<br>as if he had always lived in the shade, and an intellectual<br>face, and with his quiet manners might have passed for a divinity<br>student who had seen something of the world.<br></i>Thoreau subsequently discovered that appearances were deceptive.<br>Far from being a divinity student, his coach mate was in<br>fact a celebrated gunsmith, and &#x201c;probably the chief white hunter<br>of Maine.&#x201d; But he never learned the man&#x2019;s name, which was<br>Hiram Lewis Leonard.<br>Leonard belongs to that great American series of heroic archetypes&#x2014;<br>the lineage that includes Johnny Appleseed and Horatio<br>Alger, but above all Daniel Boone and Natty Bumppo. One historian<br>described him as &#x201c;a millwright, gunsmith, daguerrotypist,<br>flutist, trapper, moose hunter, taxidermist, and one of the very<br>early manufacturers of split bamboo fishing rods&#x201d;&#x2014;which we&#x2019;ll<br>come to in a moment.

She received her certification as a Tatting Teacher from the Great Lakes Lace Group in 1996. She is largely self taught, relying on existing books and guides to learn. The lack of clear illustrations and detailed instructions, especially the small but critical details to learning the art of tatting, was very frustrating. To remedy this she has written two books that present clearly written instructions and are profusely illustrated with digital photos to enable the student to successfully learn shuttle tatting either on their own or with an instructor. Donna and her husband currently reside in Puerto Rico where she is a registered artisan.Donna Edwards eagerly awaited "Advanced Fancy Pants: An Illustrated Guide To Intermediate and Advanced Shuttle Tatting" is now available. The product of Donna's work for certification in teaching tatting, it contains a generous amount of clear photographs (even Donna's hands are beautiful) illustrating precise verbal directions. This project was highly praised when the first version of this was shown at the International Old Lacers, Inc. Convention in 1996 - then Donna updated it with entirely new photos using digital camera technology. <p>Techniques, covered include Cluny, split ring, bridge stitch, pearl tatting and tatting with beads; there are also good tips and techniques, four of Donnas original designs given as sample projects (the one which uses Cluny is a visual explanation of why you'd want to practice this technique); a bibliography, glossary and supplier list.... there's even a Spanish supplement available... -- <i>Tatter's Bookshelf, Tatting Times May 1998</i><br><br>I have been hearing lots of positive feedback about Donna Edwards' books that I have been singing the praises about in this newsletter. Seems it is going over quite well... Both books are very well illustrated using a digital camera. The advanced book has 4 original patterns to utilize the techniques being taught. i.e. continuous thread, decorative techniques including fancy stitches and beading, advanced techniques to enhance your tatting. Lots of helpful hints in both books.... -- <i>Doretha Albee, Tatting Knots &amp; Notes January 1999</i></p></p><h2>Historical Atlas of Ancient America</h2><p>Traces the history of Mesoamerican civilization covering its origins, peoples, art, beliefs, conquests, and mythology.</p><p>Norman Bancroft Hunt graduated from Kingston School of Art in 1968. He was elected fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute in 1975 and is currently a lecturer and researcher in visual theory and cultural studies at the Kent Institute of Art and Design. As an author he has written numerous books about Native American art and culture, including the award-winning People of the Totem.Hunt, the author of over 15 books on Native America (e.g., People of the Totem), here presents a lay reader's overview of the Mesoamerican cultures from about 1500 B.C.E. to about 1500 C.E. (e.g., Olmec, Maya, and Aztec). After defining terms and giving a summary of the cultures to be presented in a two-page introduction, Hunt moves on to explore each culture in seven enlightening chapters. The energetic and readable text is accompanied by many color illustrations and maps (either in the first two pages of most chapters to pinpoint major sites or within the text to show building locations at given sites). Perhaps the most refreshing quality of this attractive tome is the author's uncompromising honesty whenever little is known. Suitable for both public and academic libraries.

You can contact Shannon through her website, www.shannonstacey.com, as well as sign up for her newsletter.<br><br>The snarling, possibly rabid, five hundred pound grizzly bear lurking in the trees was the final straw.<br><br>Hailey Genest stopped in her tracks, staring at the area of the forest where she'd heard the rustling. Okay, so maybe it wasn't a grizzly bear. She didn't think Maine had grizzlies, even deep in the woods. It was probably only a black bear, but it was a <em>really</em> big one.<br><br>"I think it was a chipmunk," her buddy system partner said.<br><br>Hailey turned her stare on Tori Burns, who'd talked her into this stupid wilderness adventure. "I hate you so much right now."<br><br>Tori grinned. "Your mascara's smudging."<br><br>"Why are we friends again?"<br><br>"Because you came into the diner during my shift and whined about being the last single woman on the entire planet because all of your friends have found their soul mates. When I pointed out I'm single, you decided <em>we</em> should be friends."<br><br>She hadn't been whining. She'd just had a rough day and hadn't felt like she could call her friends to vent because they were all probably greeting their menfolk at the door. And, yes, she had imagined them in aprons and pearls just because she could.<br><br>"First Paige married Mitch, then Lauren ran off to Massachusetts and married Ryan, and Katie's living with Josh." Hailey snorted and crossed her arms. "Those damn Kowalski men stole all my women."<br><br>Tori sighed. "And now <em>I'm</em> friends with a woman who wears makeup and new hiking boots on a wilderness adventure."<br><br>"The better I look, the better I feel and I thought I'd need the boost." She looked down at her feet, trying not to wince. "Pretty sure my blisters are reaching horror movie proportions, though."<br><br>"I told you it would be better to wear sneakers than brand-new hiking boots."<br><br>"I wanted to be fashionable."<br><br>"Yes, because limping is totally the new black."<br><br>Hailey took a few steps, trying to ignore how much her feet, calves and every other part of her body hurt, but then she stopped. "Listen."<br><br>After several seconds, Tori frowned. "I can't hear the others anymore."<br><br>"Not even the woman who sounds like she has a built-in megaphone and sucked helium for breakfast. They left us behind." Even as she said the words, which should have been cause for concern, Hailey felt a pang of relief.<br><br>If the group had left them behind, there was no pressure to keep up, which was something she'd been failing at miserably for at least a mile. She considered herself to be in good shape, but hiking for miles over uneven ground in the woods was kicking her butt. And they still had paddling canoes to look forward to, just to make sure her arms and back ached as much as her legs tomorrow.<br><br>Since her usual daily workout was pushing a cart of books from the night drop box back into the library, she could only wonder what she'd been thinking. Or drinking.<br><br>"If we hurry, we can catch them." Tori cast a doubtful glance at Hailey's feet. "If it helps, we get to <em>sit</em> in the canoes."<br><br>The thought of being off her feet did help a little, so Hailey did her best to keep up with her new friend. Tori wasn't very tall, but she walked with a long, confident stride that was hard to match. Trying to ignore how her impending blisters and the muscles in the backs of her calves were having a contest to see which could burn the worst, Hailey put one foot in front of the other and tried not to stumble over roots.<br><br>After what felt like miles, Tori stopped in a clearing and shook her head. There were several paths in front of them and they all looked the same degree of disturbed. No matter how hard she looked, Hailey couldn't tell which one their group had taken.<br><br>"Aren't they supposed to break off tree branches or something to point the way?" she asked.<br><br>"We weren't kidnapped by Magua. We just didn't keep up. I think if the tour guides noticed they'd lost us, they would have waited rather than leave signs for us to interpret."<br><br>Hailey slapped herself in the face, then grimaced. "I'm going to need a blood transfusion before we get out of these woods."<br><br>"I have some Deep Woods Off in my pack. You want it?"<br><br>"No. I already have bug repellent on." She waved at a particularly persistent blackfly. "It's all natural and it nourishes my skin. It smells good, too."<br><br>"Too bad it doesn't keep the bugs away."<br><br>"The comments on Pinterest said it wasn't <em>quite</em> as effective as the chemical versions, but did I mention it's nourishing?"<br><br>Tori snorted. "And now you're nourishing the blackflies."<br><br>"I suck at being outside."<br><br>"You <em>are</em> surprisingly bad at it for somebody born and raised in rural Maine."<br><br>"Whitford's rural, but it's not <em>this</em> rural." Hailey wanted to point out her parents had chosen Whit-ford, not her, but a bug almost flew into her mouth, so she closed it.<br><br>"Well." Tori put her hands on her hips. "We're lost."<br><br>Matt Barnett leaned against a tree trunk and imagined himself at a crossroads. To the left was the low road. He could continue his walk in peace, making his way back to camp. Crack a beer with his old man. Drop a line in the river.<br><br>To the right was the high road, which meant approaching the two women whose voices carried through the trees like sirens. The fire truck kind, not the beautiful women luring sailors onto the rocks. They were lost, and rescuing damsels in distress wasn't on his vacation agenda.<br><br>Then again, vacations weren't supposed to have agendas. And as much as he wanted to kick back in his favorite fishing chair with a beer, it wasn't in his nature to leave two women alone in the woods. Unless, of course, they'd done it on purpose and it didn't sound like that was the case here.<br><br>With a weary sigh, he pushed off the tree and made his way to the women. He stepped out onto the path in front of them and had to give them credit for not screaming. They both yelped a little and the brunette dug her fingernails into the blonde's arm, but no full-blown hysterics.<br><br>He couldn't really blame them for being startled. Being on the downside of a two week vacation, Matt was looking more than a little rough. The jeans and flannel shirt were common enough, but his lucky fishing hat was nothing short of disgusting after years of wear. His hair had been overdue for a cut before the vacation even started, and he hadn't shaved since the last day he worked. If he'd been holding an axe, the women probably would have fainted.<br><br>"You ladies lost?"<br><br>"Nope." It was the brunette who spoke. She looked him straight in the eye while she lied. "We're all set, but thanks."<br><br>"Where you heading?"<br><br>This time it was the blonde who spoke, and she pointed at a spot over his shoulder. "Since we're facing that way, probably that way. Now if you'll excuse us, we-"<br><br>"Sound carries in the woods, so I know you're lost." He had a cabin and a dwindling vacation to get back to. "I'm Matt Barnett. I have a cabin a couple miles from here. I've been coming here my whole life and I haven't buried a single body in the woods yet."<br><br>"We totally believe you," the brunette said. "Because serial killers always start the conversation with how many bodies they've disposed of."<br><br>Even though there was a touch of humor in her voice, he noticed neither of them relaxed, which was good. Women shouldn't trust strange men who popped out of the tree line. But he also wanted to get this show on the road. If he had to tell them he was a game warden, he would, but he'd try to avoid it if he could. That, more often than not, led to questions and complaints and friends of friends who'd been cited and could he just look into that? He didn't want to go there, if possible.<br><br>"Let's go with the theory I'm <em>not</em> a serial killer for a few minutes," he said. "I'm not leaving you stranded in the woods, so the way I see it you ladies have two options. You can let me lead, which means I'll be in front of you and you can keep an eye on me, or I can shadow you, which means you won't be able to see me, but I'll be able to see you. That would be creepy."<br><br>"Or we could run," the blonde said.<br><br>He'd always been partial to brunettes in the past, and this one should have caught his eye. She was cute and had the potential to be a real firecracker, but for some reason it was the blonde who kept snagging his attention. Nothing about her-from the makeup she'd put on her face for a trek through the woods to the brand-new boots on her feet-was his type.<br><br>And she was looking at him like he'd just crawled out from behind a Dumpster. He'd seen that look before and he tended to not like women who aimed it his way.<br><br>She could probably run. The jeans and the form-fitting fleece zip-up she was wearing accented the fact she was in nice shape. But those boots had to be hurting her and the way her makeup was smearing around her pretty brown eyes told him she'd been sweating. If walking through the woods was an effort for her, running would be a joke.<br><br>"Pretty sure I could catch you."<br><br>The brunette snickered. "Of course you'd catch her. I'm faster than her, plus everybody knows the blondes always die first."<br><br>"You guys are hilarious," her friend muttered.<br><br>"I'm Tori," the brunette said. "And this is Hailey. We've gotten separated from our group and, at the rate we're going, I'm not sure we'll ever catch up."<br><br>Progress, finally. "Which outfit are you with?"<br><br>"Dagneau Adventure Tours."<br><br>Keeping a straight face was one of the hardest things he'd ever done. Those boys had moments of competence, but they'd inherited the business from their father and were in it solely to thumb their noses at nine-to-five jobs. He thought they were idiots, personally. "Did you research Dagneau Adventure Tours before you signed up?"<br><br>"They had a great website," Hailey said.<br><br>Tori nodded. "And they offered the specific package we were looking for."<br><br>"What package was that?"<br><br>He watched Hailey try to jam her friend's ribs with her elbow, but Tori easily evaded it. "We wanted an adventure geared toward celebrating being single. Like, no couples stuff."<br><br>So the pretty blonde was single. Not that it mattered, but it was a tidbit of information his brain seemed to want to file away, just in case.<br><br>"In the future, you should get referrals and ask for references," he said. "You shouldn't take the company's word for it when it comes to your safety. Especially when it comes to the outdoors. Nature's pretty, but can be a real bitch at times."<br><br>"Thank you, Jeremiah Johnson," Hailey muttered, and when she blushed under his hard look, he assumed she hadn't meant for him to hear it.<br><br>"Tell me what the itinerary was, starting with where you parked," he said to Tori, choosing to ignore the implication he was some kind of hermit backwoodsman.<br><br>Once she'd laid out the plan for the day, Matt was faced with another decision. It was really six of one, half dozen of another as to whether it made more sense to help them find their group or take them out of the woods. But Hailey looked as if she'd had enough adventure for the day and, even though she didn't seem to like him very much, it went against his nature to see a woman miserable and not try to make it better.<br><br>"I think it's closer to head back to your car than to try to meet up with your group. Especially since your car won't be moving away from us while we're trying to catch it."<br><br>Tori waved her hand. "Lead on, then."<br><br>Hailey hesitated. "It seems wrong to just leave. What if they come back to look for us?"<br><br>"They deserve it," Tori said. "For leaving us."<br><br>"Maybe the idiots in charge do, but not the rest of the women."<br><br>Matt sighed. Leave it to the Dagneau boys to come up with a way to get a bunch of single women into the woods. He made a mental note to have a closer look at their business and maybe rustle through their paperwork as he pulled his satellite phone out of the holster on his hip.<br><br>"Your phone works out here?"<br><br>"It's a satellite phone." It was a personal phone, in addition to the work cell phone he'd been issued. "My family spends a lot of time up here and I don't like being cut off from the world."<br><br>He started walking as he called into dispatch and asked them to relay to the Dagneau brothers that two of their guests had been lost and found. When he was done, he put the phone away and then looked over his shoulder to see how the women were faring.<br><br>They were still where he'd left them, and he was already too far away to make out their expressions. He held up his hands in a <em>what are you waiting for</em> motion and then had to wait while they caught up.<br><br>"We weren't sure if you wanted privacy for your phone call," Hailey explained. "Sorry."<br><br>He hadn't missed her wincing as she approached, but there wasn't much he could do about it. He certainly wasn't carrying her back to her car and he couldn't get his truck close enough to where they were to make a difference. By ATV he could, but it would take longer to go get it, get back and make individual trips with the women than it was worth. She'd have to suck it up.<br><br>"Let's go, ladies." He set off down the path, keeping a slightly slower than moderate pace and pointing out rocks and roots in the path.<br><br></p><h2>Duplicity (A Fina Ludlow Novel)</h2><p><b>Gutsy Boston P.I.

She stretched her hands toward its warmth. &#x201c;Hard to believe it&#x2019;s spring and there are flowers blooming somewhere.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s New England in March,&#x201d; Carl commented.<br><br>&#x201c;Elaine and the rest of the family?&#x201d; Ceci asked. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re well?&#x201d;<br><br>At the mention of her mother, Fina&#x2019;s back tightened. Not too long ago, she&#x2019;d dropped a bombshell on Elaine, and their already strained relationship would put the Cold War to shame.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; Carl said. Fina could detect a note of impatience in his voice. Her father wasn&#x2019;t much for small talk.<br><br>Ceci took a seat on the sofa facing them and crossed her ankles. &#x201c;I wish I could say the same for the Renards. We have a situation, and I need help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Carl said, shifting forward in his seat. Her father was a problem solver at heart&#x2014;he liked to get stuff done. &#x201c;My assistant said that you sent a retainer, so anything you say to me is protected by privilege.&#x201d;<br><br>Ceci glanced at Fina, a question on her face.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s covered by attorney-client privilege,&#x201d; Carl assured her. &#x201c;Just think of Fina as an extension of me.&#x201d;<br><br>Fina fought not to roll her eyes.<br><br>Ceci pushed a strand of hair behind one ear. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m very concerned about my daughter Chloe. She&#x2019;s recently become involved with a church, and I think they are having undue influence on her.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; Carl asked.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s drifting away from our family, and her judgment has been compromised.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is she in danger?&#x201d; Carl asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No, but I&#x2019;m worried&#x2014;I&#x2019;m actually starting to feel panicked, truth be told.&#x201d; Ceci looked away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure how to best describe the situation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you start at the beginning,&#x201d; Fina suggested. &#x201c;How old is Chloe?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thirty.&#x201d;<br><br>Fina and Carl exchanged a glance.<br><br>&#x201c;I know she&#x2019;s not a child anymore, but this isn&#x2019;t like her, and there&#x2019;s a great deal at risk.&#x201d; Ceci&#x2019;s gaze drifted to the family photos on the mantel. She focused on one of a young woman in cap and gown, her hands clasping a diploma.<br><br>There was rustling in the hallway, and Ceci looked toward the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been so rude. I didn&#x2019;t even offer you coffee or tea.&#x201d; She pushed herself out of the deep couch.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re fine,&#x201d; Carl said. &#x201c;Your housekeeper already made the offer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, good.&#x201d; Ceci settled back into the cushions.<br><br>&#x201c;So this church,&#x201d; Fina prompted.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s called Covenant Rising Church, and it&#x2019;s based in Framingham. It&#x2019;s a born-again evangelical organization.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And you&#x2019;re not evangelical?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No. I was raised as a Methodist and my husband, Victor, was raised Catholic. He&#x2019;s from France. I didn&#x2019;t like Covenant Rising&#x2019;s theology from the outset,&#x201d; she continued, &#x201c;but I tried to be supportive. I worried that if I were critical, Chloe would resent it and that would only strengthen her commitment to the church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your relationship with your daughter like?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>Ceci met her gaze. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve always been close, but she&#x2019;s become distant as her involvement with the church has grown.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has something changed recently?&#x201d; Carl asked. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happened that&#x2019;s made you so worried?&#x201d;<br><br>Ceci adjusted the delicate gold watch on her wrist. &#x201c;My husband and I created trusts for Chloe and her older sister, Veronique, which pay out money to them at various milestones. We&#x2019;ve also deeded property to them. I recently learned that Chloe is in the process of turning over a significant holding to Covenant Rising.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ahh,&#x201d; Carl said, nodding. &#x201c;But she&#x2019;s thirty&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br><br>Ceci shook her head. &#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re going to say, Carl. That she&#x2019;s an adult, and she can do what she wants with her money, but if she were thinking straight, she wouldn&#x2019;t give away this property. Chloe went through a very difficult breakup about a year ago, and I think that is influencing some of her choices.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In what way?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I think she&#x2019;s been having a quarter-life crisis. The man she thought would become her husband and the father of her children was not, in fact, &#x2018;the one.&#x2019; She was at sea trying to figure out what was next, and a friend introduced her to the church. They&#x2019;ve given Chloe free rein to develop an arts therapy outreach program, which has been a dream of&nbsp;hers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But just to be clear, you don&#x2019;t have control over the property, correct?&#x201d; Carl asked.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s correct.&#x201d;<br><br>They were quiet for a moment, contemplating the limits of Ceci&#x2019;s influence.<br><br>&#x201c;And there&#x2019;s no point in calling the cops,&#x201d; Carl commented, &#x201c;because there&#x2019;s nothing illegal going on.&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;Lest you think I haven&#x2019;t tried to deal with this on my own, I was in touch with the church leadership, but no one will speak with me or at least tell me anything substantive.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re stonewalling you?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; Ceci was literally wringing her hands as she recounted her experience. &#x201c;Even though no crime has been committed, they are, in essence, stealing from Chloe.&#x201d;<br><br>Fina looked at her father. That was a bit of a stretch.<br><br>&#x201c;I found some articles on the Internet,&#x201d; Ceci said, moving to a small desk in the corner of the room and picking up a file folder. She shuffled through the papers before handing a small sheaf to Carl. &#x201c;I want to sue them for alienation. I know it&#x2019;s a difficult prospect, but there have been other cases.&#x201d;<br><br>He scanned the papers, and Ceci returned to the couch.<br><br>&#x201c;This sort of case is very difficult to win, Ceci.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know, but I&#x2019;m desperate. It&#x2019;s not just about the money and the bequest. I feel like I&#x2019;m losing my daughter, Carl. We&#x2019;ve always been so close, and now there&#x2019;s a wall between us that I can&#x2019;t seem to breach.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t live with the group, does she?&#x201d; Fina asked. Carl passed the printouts to her.<br><br>&#x201c;No, and she has a job unrelated to Covenant Rising. Believe me, I would hire an extraction expert if that would help, but it&#x2019;s not like that.&#x201d; Ceci rubbed her temple as if massaging away a headache. &#x201c;It seems like she&#x2019;s not making her own decisions anymore: The lead pastor is. He&#x2019;s only in it for the money and the power, but Chloe doesn&#x2019;t see it that way. I know you think I&#x2019;m overreacting, but I&#x2019;m telling you this is a dangerous situation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody joins a cult,&#x201d; Fina murmured. Her father looked at her. &#x201c;Nobody signs up thinking they&#x2019;re joining a cult,&#x201d; she clarified. &#x201c;They only figure it out when it&#x2019;s too late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly,&#x201d; Ceci said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want it to be too late.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A lawsuit becomes very public, very quickly,&#x201d; Carl cautioned. &#x201c;Are you and Victor prepared for that?&#x201d;<br><br>Ceci swallowed. &#x201c;Victor spends most of his time in Paris.&#x201d;<br><br>Carl considered that for a moment. &#x201c;But the world is a small place these days, Cee. He won&#x2019;t be immune to publicity and gossip, even on another continent.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not happy about the possibility, but if that&#x2019;s what it takes to get Chloe away from this organization, that&#x2019;s what we need to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Carl massaged his knuckles. &#x201c;Maybe there&#x2019;s a chink in the armor we can use,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and a suit won&#x2019;t even be necessary.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can do some digging,&#x201d; Fina offered.<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll research our legal options.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does Chloe know how you feel about the church and her bequest?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had numerous discussions about my objections to both the church and the property transfer, but she won&#x2019;t budge. There&#x2019;s no point in continuing to have the same dead-end conversation. I&#x2019;ve let her know that I&#x2019;m hiring some people to perform due diligence, and my hope is something will come up that will change her mind.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And that&#x2019;s okay with her? Due diligence?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t object. We&#x2019;ve always impressed upon our children the need to take care of their assets,&#x201d; Ceci said. &#x201c;Obviously, Chloe didn&#x2019;t learn that lesson. That&#x2019;s the thing about my daughter: She&#x2019;s extraordinarily trusting, which is both an asset and a liability.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But she won&#x2019;t be surprised if I contact her?&#x201d; Fina asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;ve told her to expect a call,&#x201d; Ceci said. &#x201c;I would just ask that you not discuss the possibility of a lawsuit. Not yet, at least.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure Fina can navigate the situation,&#x201d; Carl said.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Fina said. She appreciated the vote of confidence, but worried that Carl was making a promise she would have to keep.<br><br>&#x201c;Can you start right away? The bequest is already in motion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get right on it,&#x201d; Fina said, while her father nodded.<br><br>Ceci exhaled loudly. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what a relief this is. I&#x2019;m at my wit&#x2019;s end.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You should have called me sooner,&#x201d; Carl said.<br><br>&#x201c;I know. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me, until I saw one of your ads.&#x201d; Ceci dipped her head sheepishly. Fina wasn&#x2019;t sure if she was embarrassed on her own behalf or on behalf of Carl. He starred in his own TV ads that aired with alarming frequency, touting the benefits of Ludlow and Associates, the family&#x2019;s personal injury law firm. The TV ads were cheesy and seemingly ubiquitous, but obviously effective.<br><br>Carl smiled. &#x201c;I know that my ads aren&#x2019;t your style, Cee, but they get the job done.&#x201d;<br><br>Ceci smiled briefly, and they sat for a moment in awkward silence.<br><br>Fina spoke, hoping to break the weird spell between the former flames. &#x201c;Depending upon how cooperative Chloe is, I may need more information from you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course. Just let me know.&#x201d; Ceci stood, and Fina and Carl followed her to the door of the living room.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a beautiful painting,&#x201d; Fina said, pointing to a large canvas. It depicted a man and woman sitting in a crowded restaurant, the man leaning toward the woman as if to whisper in her ear. She looked distracted, her hand reaching toward the candle on the table.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s one of Chloe&#x2019;s,&#x201d; Ceci said with a wide smile.<br><br>&#x201c;She painted that?&#x201d; Fina took a step forward to examine it more closely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m no expert, but it&#x2019;s beautiful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s very talented,&#x201d; Ceci said.<br><br>Fina offered Ceci her card, and they shook hands. Her father and&nbsp;Ceci reenacted the fumbling embrace that had kicked off the meeting.<br><br>Back on the street, Fina and Carl stood next to their cars. &#x201c;Remind me,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;when did you guys stop dating?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A long time ago. Around college.&#x201d; He clicked his keys, and his car started remotely.<br><br>&#x201c;Huh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It just seems like it was more recent than that. Usually after forty years, people loosen up a little.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re from a different generation.&#x201d; Carl opened his door. &#x201c;I want you to give this your full attention.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Top priority.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I get it, Dad.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Good. I expect results.&#x201d; He ducked into the car.<br><br>&#x201c;You always do. Dad! Wait! We never finished our Rand conver-sation.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;ll have to wait, Fina. I&#x2019;m late for a meeting,&#x201d; Carl said.<br><br>&#x201c;This is bullshit! What the hell is going on?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We will discuss it later,&#x201d; he said before slamming his door. He took off in the direction of Harvard Square.<br><br>&#x201c;Dammit,&#x201d; she exclaimed, watching him drive away. Fina climbed into her car and turned the key in the ignition.<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t know exactly what Rand&#x2019;s return portended, but one thing was sure: It was nothing good.<br><br>Fina pulled into the parking lot of her niece&#x2019;s school and scrolled through her e-mail. Haley was due out of her after-school activities at any moment.<br><br>It had been nearly a year since her brother Rand&#x2019;s wife, Melanie, had been murdered, and since then things with their daughter, Haley,&nbsp;had been touch and go. Fina&#x2019;s brother Scotty and his wife, Patty, had become her de facto parents. Haley was adjusting to their household and to her role as an older sister to their three young sons, but Fina didn&#x2019;t underestimate how difficult such a change could be.<br><br>Haley emerged from the school five minutes later and scanned the parking lot. When she started back toward the front door, Fina called her cell phone.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t go back inside,&#x201d; she told Haley. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to pick you up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you picking me up? I thought it was going to be Aunt Patty.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since when do I need a reason to see my favorite niece?&#x201d; Fina watched Haley start back into the lot.<br><br>&#x201c;Your only niece. I don&#x2019;t see your car.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Walk to your right.&#x201d;<br><br>Haley did a slow turn and started walking in her direction. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you ever drive something fancy?&#x201d; Haley asked. It was odd watching her lips move as she approached, but only hearing the words through the phone.<br><br>&#x201c;Because of my job. I don&#x2019;t want to be conspicuous. I need to blend&nbsp;in.&#x201d;<br><br>Haley ended the call and slipped her phone into her pocket before reaching ...</p><h2>Top 10 IRA Mistakes - How to Avoid IRS Tax Traps</h2><p>This well written and informative book, written by David F.

It captures the legacy and wisdom of one of the most important conductors of our time.

(<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)</p><h2>Resentment: A Comedy</h2><p>Based on the real-life trial of the Menendez brothers and written with visceral, apocalyptic force, Gary Indiana's critically acclaimed novel, <i>Resentment,</i> is a dark comedy of manners that takes as its subject nothing less than the complete and total dissolution of society and the justice system. <br><br>Seth, a New York journalist, is on assignment in Los Angeles to cover the infamous trial of two adolescent boys accused of blowing away their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills mansion. The novel follows Seth as he maneuvers among the bizarre chorus of characters that make up modern-day Los Angeles, including a judge with obsessive/compulsive disorder, a witness with Tourette's Syndrome, a taxi driver/screenwriter with AIDS, a budding serial killer/gigolo, and a name-dropping society novelist. "Resentment is not only hilariously toxic satire that skewers various gargoyles of Southern California with deadly precision and dark wit," writes Patrick McGrath, "It is also a rattling good story, generated and furiously driven forward by a moral vision that is new to American fiction."</p><p>Since the mid-1970s, Gary Indiana has been making a name for himself as a renegade thinker and writer. In the <i>Village Voice</i> and <i>Rolling Stone</i> he created a new brand of highly personal, overtly political cultural commentary that has reshaped journalism. His novels and short stories are equally controversial. <i>Resentment,</i> his new novel, is a true hybrid of his art. Based on Indiana's coverage of the Menendez brothers' trial, the novel is an all-out, savagely funny attack on the media, the U.S. justice system, television, family, and Los Angeles. Indiana is relentless in his desire to expose the insanity that rages beneath the surface of U.S. life and determined to make us laugh out loud even as we shake our heads in sorry recognition.<i>Day of the Locusts</i> meets <i>Bonfire of the Vanities</i> in this searing burlesque about everyone from the east coast literati to Hollywood's superagents, actors, has-beens and wannabes. Gary Indiana takes no prisoners as he sets his "hero," B-magazine writer Seth, out in Los Angeles to do a celebrity profile of a famous hetero actor who has just taken a major role as a homosexual with AIDS. While on the West Coast, Seth becomes mildly, then completely obsessed with the trial of two privileged young men who are accused of killing their parents in cold blood as they lay sleeping in their Beverly Hills home. <p></p><p>Indiana weaves the story of Seth and his not inconsequential resentment for the world at large with the riveting "Martinez" case as it unfolds before the American public. Ironically, hilariously, and ingeniously, Indiana juxtaposes both stories in this blackest of comedies, as he reveals the role of resentment in all human relationships, and the darker side of L.A. roiling beneath the glamour. The media loves nothing more than itself, and no writer/agent/actor/journalist will be able to resist this tell-all novel about all the beautiful people.</p></p><h2>The Probable Future</h2><p><p>Alice Hoffman&#x2019;s most magical novel to date&#x2014;three generations of extraordinary women are driven to unite in crisis and discover the rewards of reconciliation and love. <br><br>Women of the Sparrow family have unusual gifts. Elinor can detect falsehood. Her daughter, Jenny, can see people&#x2019;s dreams when they sleep. Granddaughter Stella has a mental window on the future&#x2014;a future that she might not want to see. <br><br>In <i>The Probable Future</i> this vivid and intriguing cast of characters confronts a haunting past&#x2014;and a very current murder&#x2014;against the evocative backdrop of small-town New England. By turns chilling and enchanting, <i>The Probable Future</i> chronicles the Sparrows&#x2019;s legacy as young Stella struggles to cope with her disturbing clairvoyance. Her potential to ruin or redeem becomes unbearable when one of her premonitions puts her father in jail, wrongly accused of homicide. Yet this ordeal also leads Stella to the grandmother she was forbidden to meet and to a historic family home full of talismans from her ancestors. <br><br>Poignant, arresting, unsettling, <i>The Probable Future</i> showcases the lavish literary gifts that have made Alice Hoffman one of America&#x2019;s most treasured writers.</p></p><p><p>Alice Hoffman is the author of fifteen acclaimed novels, most recently <i>Blue Diary</i>. She lives outside Boston.</p>THE VISION<br><br>I. Anyone born and bred in Massachusetts learns early on to recognize the end of winter. Babies in their cribs point to the brightening of the sky before they can crawl. Level-headed men weep at the first call of the warblers. Upstanding women strip off their clothes and dive into inlets and ponds before the ice has fully melted, unconcerned if their fingers and toes turn blue. Spring fever affects young and old alike; it spares no one and makes no distinctions, striking when happiness is least expected, when joy is only a memory, when the skies are still cloudy and snow is still piled onto the cold, hard ground.<br><br>Who could blame the citizens of Massachusetts for rejoicing when spring is so close at hand? Winter in New England is merciless and cruel, a season that instills a particular melancholy in its residents and a hopelessness that is all but impossible to shake. In the small towns surrounding Boston, the leaden skies and snowy vistas cause a temporary color blindness, a condition that can be cured only by the appearance of the first green shoots of spring. It isn't unusual for whole populations of certain towns to find they have tears in their eyes all through the month of March, and there are those who insist they can see clearly for the very first time.<br><br>Still, there are some who are slower to discern the signs of spring. They distrust March and declare it to be the most perilous time of the year. These are the stubborn individuals who continue to wear woolen coats on the finest of days, who insist it is impossible to tell the difference between a carpet of snowdrops and a stretch of ice in this slippery season, even with twenty-twenty vision. Such people cannot be convinced that lions will ever be turned into lambs. In their opinion, anyone born in March is sure to possess curious traits that mirror the fickle season, hot one minute, cold the next. Unreliable is March's middle name, no one could deny that. Its children are said to be just as unpredictable.<br><br>In some cases, this is assuredly true. For as long as their history has been known, there have been only girl children born to the Sparrow family and every one of these daughters has kept the family name and celebrated her birthday in March. Even those babies whose due dates were declared to be safely set within the snowy margins of February or the pale reaches of April managed to be born in March. No matter when an infant was due to arrive, as soon as the first snowdrops bloomed in New England, a Sparrow baby would begin to stir. Once leaves began to bud, once the Blue Star crocus unfolded, the womb could no longer contain one of these children, not when spring fever was so very near.<br><br>And yet Sparrow babies were as varied as the days of March. Some were calm and wide-eyed, born with open hands, always the sign of a generous nature, while others arrived squalling and agitated, so full of outrage they were quickly bundled into blue blankets, to ward off nervous ailments and apoplexy. There were babies in the Sparrow family who had been born while big, soft snowflakes fell and Boston Harbor froze solid, and those whose births took place on the mildest of days, so that they drew their first breaths while the robins built nests out of straw and twigs and the red maples blushed with a first blooming.<br><br>But whether the season had been fair or foul, in all this time there had been only one baby to be born feet first, the mark of a healer, and that child was Stella Sparrow Avery. For thirteen generations, each one of the Sparrow girls had come into this world with inky hair and dark, moody eyes, but Stella was pale, her ashy hair and hazel eyes inherited, the labor nurses supposed, from her handsome father's side of the family. Hers was a difficult birth, life-threatening for both mother and child. Every attempt to turn the baby had failed, and soon enough the doctors had begun to dread the outcome of the day. The mother, Jenny Avery, an independent, matter-of-fact woman, who had run away from home at seventeen and was as unsentimental as she was self-reliant, found herself screaming for her mother. That she should cry for her mother, who had been so distant and cold, whom she hadn't even spoken to in more than a decade, astounded Jenny even more than the rigors of birth. It was a wonder her mother wasn't able to hear her, for although Elinor Sparrow was nearly fifty miles from Boston, Jenny's cries were piercing, desperate enough to reach even the most remote and hard-hearted. Women on the ward who had just begun their labor stuck their fingers in their ears and practiced their breathing techniques, praying for an easier time. Orderlies wished they were home in bed, with the covers drawn up. Patients in the cardiac unit felt their hearts race, and down in the cafeteria the lemon puddings curdled and had to be thrown away.<br><br>At last the child arrived, after seventeen hours of brutal labor. The obstetrician in charge snapped one tiny shoulder to ease the birth, for the mother's pulse was rapidly dropping. It was at this very moment, when the baby's head slipped free and Jenny Avery thought she might lose consciousness, that the cloudy sky cleared to reveal the silvery splash of the Milky Way, the heart of the universe. Jenny blinked in the sudden light which poured in through the window. She saw how beautiful the world was, as though for the very first time. The bowl of stars, the black night, the life of her child, all came together in a single band of light.<br><br>Jenny hadn't particularly wanted a baby; she hadn't yearned for one the way some women did, hadn't gazed longingly at rocking horses and cribs. Her stormy relationship with her own mother had made her wary of family ties, and her marriage to Will Avery, surely one of the most irresponsible men in New England, hadn't seemed the proper setting in which to raise a child. And yet it had happened: this baby had arrived on a starry night in March, the month of the Sparrows, season of snow and of spring, of lions and lambs, of endings and beginnings, green month, white month, month of heartache, month of extreme good luck.<br><br>The infant's first cries weren't heard until she was tucked into a flannel bunting; then little yelps echoed from her tiny mouth, as though she were a cat caught in a puddle. The baby was easily soothed, just a pat or two on the back from the doctor, but it was too late: her cries had gone right through Jenny, a hook piercing through blood and bones. Jenny Sparrow Avery was no longer aware of her husband, or the nurses with whom he was flirting. She didn't care about the blood on the floor or the trembling in her legs or even the Milky Way above them in the sky. Her eyes were filled with dizzying circles of light, little pinpricks that glimmered inside her eyelids. It wasn't starlight, but something else entirely. Something she couldn't comprehend until the doctor handed her the child, the damaged left shoulder taped up with white adhesive as though it were a broken wing. Jenny gazed into her child's calm face. In that instant she experienced complete devotion. Then and there, on the fifth floor of Brigham and Women's Hospital, she understood what it meant to be blinded by love.<br><br>The labor nurses soon crowded around, cooing and praising the baby. Although they had seen hundreds of births, this child was indeed exceptional. It wasn't her pale hair or luminous complexion which distinguished her, but her sweet temperament. Good as gold, the nurses murmured approvingly, quiet as ashes. Even the most jaded had to agree this child was special. Perhaps her character was a result of her birth date, for Jenny's daughter had arrived on the twentieth of March, the equinox, when day and night are of equal length. Indeed, in one tiny, exhausted body, there seemed to exist all of March's traits, the evens and the odds, the dark and the light, a child who would always be as comfortable with lions as she was with lambs.<br><br>Jenny named the baby Stella, with Will's approval, of course. For despite the many problems in the marriage, on this one point they agreed: this child was their radiant and wondrous star. There was nothing Jenny would not do for their daughter. She, who had not spoken to her own mother for years, who had not so much as mailed a postcard back home after she'd run off with Will, now felt powerless to resist the mighty forces of her own maternal instinct. She was bewitched by this tiny creature; the rest of the world fell away with a shudder, leaving only their Stella. Jenny's child would not spend a single night apart from her. Even in the hospital she kept Stella by her side rather than let her be brought to the nursery. Jenny Sparrow Avery knew exactly what could happen if you weren't there to watch over your child. She was quite aware of how wrong things could go between mothers and daughters.<br><br>Not everyone was doomed to repeat history, however. Family flaws and old sorrows needn't rule their lives, or so Jenny told herself every night as she checked on her sleeping daughter. What was the past, after all, but a leaden shackle one had a duty to try and escape? It was possible to break chains, regardless of how old or how rusted, of that Jenny was certain. It was possible to forge an entirely new life. But chains made out of blood and memory were a thousand times more difficult to sever than those made of steel, and the past could overtake a person if she wasn't careful. A woman had to be vigilant or before she knew it she'd find herself making the same mistakes her own mother had made, with the same resentments set to boil.<br><br>Jenny was not about to let herself relax or take the slightest bit of good fortune for granted. There wasn't a day when she wasn't on guard. Let other mothers chat on the phone and hire baby-sitters; let them sit on blankets in the Boston Common on sunny days and on blustery afternoons make angels in the snow. Jenny didn't have time for such nonsense. She had only thirteen years in which to prevail over her family's legacy, and she planned to do exactly that, no matter the cost to herself.<br><br>In no time she b...</p><h2>Mockingjay 10th Anniversary (Hunger Games Trilogy)</h2><p>Against all odds, Katniss Everdeen has survived the Hunger Games twice.

In 1942, when World War II exploded onto its shores, it was an inhospitable, cursorily mapped, disease-ridden land of dense jungle, towering mountain peaks, deep valleys, and fetid swamps. Coveted by the Japanese for its strategic position, New Guinea became the site of one of the South Pacific&#x2019;s most savage campaigns. Despite their lack of jungle training, the 32nd Division&#x2019;s Ghost Mountain Boys were assigned the most grueling mission of the entire Pacific campaign: to march 130 miles over the rugged Owen Stanley Mountains and to protect the right flank of the Australian army as they fought to push the Japanese back to the village of Buna on New Guinea&#x2019;s north coast.<br><br>Comprised of National Guardsmen from Michigan and Wisconsin, reserve officers, and draftees from across the country, the 32nd Division lacked more than training&#x2014;they were without even the basics necessary for survival. The men were not issued the specialized clothing that later became standard issue for soldiers fighting in the South Pacific; they fought in hastily dyed combat fatigues that bled in the intense humidity and left them with festering sores. They waded through brush and vines without the aid of machetes. They did not have insect repellent. Without waterproof containers, their matches were useless and the quinine and vitamin pills they carried, as well as salt and chlorination tablets, crumbled in their pockets. Exhausted and pushed to the brink of human endurance, the Ghost Mountain Boys fell victim to malnutrition and disease. Forty-two days after they set out, they arrived two miles south of Buna, nearly shattered by the experience. <br><br>Arrival in Buna provided no respite. The 32nd Division was ordered to launch an immediate assault on the Japanese position. After two months of furious&#x2014;sometimes hand-to-hand&#x2014;combat, the decimated division finally achieved victory. The ferocity of the struggle for Buna was summed up in Time magazine on December 28, 1942, three weeks before the Japanese army was defeated: &#x201c;Nowhere in the world today are American soldiers engaged in fighting so desperate, so merciless, so bitter, or so bloody.&#x201d;<br><br>Reminiscent of classics like <i>Band of Brothers</i> and <i>The Things They Carried</i>, this harrowing portrait of a largely overlooked campaign is part war diary, part extreme adventure tale, and (through letters, journals, and interviews) part biography of a group of men who fought to survive in an environment every bit as fierce as the enemy they faced.</p><p>In 2006, James Campbell mounted an expedition to New Guinea and retraced the route of the Ghost Mountain Boys.&nbsp;He discovered a wilderness largely unchanged in more than sixty years. Campbell is the author of The Final Frontiersman and has written for Outside magazine as well as many other publications.&nbsp;He lives in Wisconsin with his wife and three daughters.Chapter 1<br><br>Escape to the South<br><br>On the night of March 11, 1942, Douglas MacArthur was preparing to flee the island of Corregidor, headquarters of the Allied forces in the Philippines. Only fifteen miles across the North Channel, his army was trapped on the jungle-clothed Philippine peninsula of Bataan.<br><br>MacArthur, his wife, his four-year-old son Arthur, Arthur's Cantonese amah, thirteen members of MacArthur's staff, two naval officers, and a technician gathered at the destroyed Corregidor dock. Corregidor rose dramatically from the waters of Manila Bay. What had once been a luxuriant green island was now a devastated, crater-ridden monument to the fury of the battle for the Philippines. Major General Jonathan "Skinny" Wainwright emerged from the shadows.<br><br>"Jonathan," MacArthur said, "I want you to understand my position very plainly. I'm leaving for Australia pursuant to repeated orders of the President . . . I want you to make it known throughout all elements of your command that I'm leaving over my repeated protests. If I get through to Australia you know I'll come back as soon as I can with as much as I can. In the meantime, you've got to hold."<br><br>Wainwright assured MacArthur that he would do everything in his power to hold Bataan. He wiped the tears from his eyes and MacArthur's jaw quivered. Then MacArthur composed himself and shook Wainwright's hand. "When I get back, if you're still on Bataan, I'll make you a lieutenant general."<br><br>Wainwright said simply, "I'll be on Bataan if I'm alive."<br><br>MacArthur's long personal crusade to return to the Philippines in victory had begun.<br><br>Lieutenant John "Buck" Bulkeley, a naval commander, had already inspected the four escape crafts--mahogany-hulled PT boats, seventy-seven feet from bow to stern, powered by big Packard engines. That said, the PT boats were still risky. After three months of combat, the engines were overused; the boats were fast, but not fast enough to outrun enemy destroyers. To make matters worse, the party would have to travel hundreds of miles over poorly charted waters, using only a compass, crude maps, and dead reckoning. MacArthur, though, could not be dissuaded from his plan. He had already refused to go by submarine--getting a sub to Corregidor would simply take too much time, time MacArthur did not have. Besides, he loved the PT boat, and that was how he wanted to leave the Philippines. The Japanese navy was watching for him, and MacArthur understood the implications. His wife and child were aboard Bulkeley's boat with him. And Tokyo Rose had been broadcasting threats--if captured, MacArthur would be hanged in public in Tokyo's Imperial Plaza. The Japanese, though, would never take him alive. He had two highly polished derringers and two cartridges that he planned to use as a last resort.<br><br>It was a moonlit night, and as the boats moved toward Mindoro, south of Corregidor, Lieutenant Bulkeley felt a growing apprehension. They were nearing the Japanese blockade. Pummeled by strong easterly winds, the seas churned, and visibility was poor. MacArthur, Arthur, and Arthur's nurse, lay below, miserably seasick. Arthur was running a fever and MacArthur retched violently. Though also sick, MacArthur's wife Jean tended to both her son and her husband. In the rough seas, the boats became separated, and from that point on, it was every crew for itself.<br><br>One of the four PT boats reached the rendezvous point in the Cuyo Islands and waited in the morning mist for the arrival of the others. Suddenly, the commander of the first boat sighted what he thought was a Japanese destroyer speeding toward them. He ordered five hundred gallons of gasoline jettisoned and pushed down on the throttles. Still the other ship gained on them. Realizing he could not get away, the commander reversed course and readied the torpedoes for firing. He was prepared to give the order when he recognized the oncoming ship as Bulkeley's vessel.<br><br>After the near mishap, MacArthur and his party waited for the third PT boat (the fourth boat had broken down en route). It was a hot, sultry day, and they bobbed like castaways on the water among the sandy coves and palm-fringed, volcanic islands. Two hours later, the third PT boat limped into the inlet. MacArthur now had an important decision to make. The plan was to meet the submarine Permit. At that point, they had to choose--submarine or PT boat. MacArthur was tempted to travel the rest of the way by submarine, but Bulkeley pointed out that Tagauayan, where they were to assemble, was three hours away and that they would never be able to get there in time. MacArthur was getting antsy. Knowing that there would be planes waiting to transport them to Australia, MacArthur decided to make directly for Mindanao in two of the original four PT boats.<br><br>Less than an hour after leaving, MacArthur heard the lookout shout, "Looks like an enemy cruiser!" Bulkeley drew in a deep breath when he saw the faster warship's imposing outlines. Then he calmed himself and waited for the inevitable. But the inevitable never came. The seas were rough and the PT boats lay low in the water, surrounded by whitecaps, and skidded by the cruiser without being spotted.<br><br>Hours later, in the waning light of the afternoon, they saw the hulking silhouette of a Japanese warship. They cut their engines and hoped they would be mistaken for native fishing vessels. The ruse worked. They had averted disaster--again.<br><br>On a clear night, illuminated by the moon, they continued across the Mindanao Sea bound for Cagayan on Mindanao's north coast. When they arrived at the Del Monte cannery in Cagayan in the early morning of March 13, they knew that they had slipped through the Japanese blockade.<br><br>But now the group faced another potential disaster. The plan had been to reach Cagayan by water and then to fly directly to Darwin on Australia's north coast. However, as MacArthur watched one war-weary B-17 land, he grew furious and refused to let anyone board. He had expected four reliable planes, not one dilapidated B-17.<br><br>For nearly four days MacArthur and his party risked discovery while his Commander of American Forces in Australia tried to secure navy planes. Everyone was tense, especially Major General Richard Sutherland, MacArthur's chief of staff. Sutherland fumed that they were sitting ducks. A Philippine informant could easily betray them to the Japanese, who were on the south end of the island and regularly patrolled north. On the evening of March 16, two of the navy's best Flying Fortresses landed.<br><br>Hours later, as the two bombers crossed the Celebes Sea, enemy fighters appeared out of the darkness. Terror swept through the planes. Had they made it this far only to be gunned down by enemy pilots? They could do only one thing--continue to fly their course. As he watched, the Zeros inexplicably turned back. Then MacArthur knew that they had finally escaped.<br><br>When the Flying Fortresses landed forty miles south of Darwin at Batchelor Field, two DC-3s were waiting to transport the group to Melbourne. However, MacArthur refused to fly. His wife had been very sick on the flight, and out of concern for her, he did not want to board another plane. What eventually convinced him not to travel by train was his son's condition. Authur remained very ill; his doctor did not think that he could make the long overland journey. After considerable discussion, MacArthur finally agreed to fly.<br><br>When they landed in Alice Springs to refuel, the rest of the crew went by air to South Australia; MacArthur, though, insisted now on traveling by train. But the one that serviced Alice Springs had left the previous day, so arrangements had to be made to bring in a special train.<br><br>When it arrived the next day, MacArthur, his wife and son, the amah, and General Sutherland boarded. For three and a half days and over one thousand miles, the slow, narrow-gauge train chugged through the vast, sun-scorched Australian outback to Adelaide. Nearing the city, MacArthur's deputy chief of staff boarded the train and delivered a wrenching blow: The general would not lead a great army against the Japanese. In fact, he would be fighting a shoestring campaign.<br><br>Months before, Roosevelt and Churchill had met in Washington, D.C., and together they settled on a "Germany first" policy, determining that the Atlantic-European theater would be the main focus of operations. MacArthur was nearly speechless at the news. "God have mercy on us" was all he could say.<br><br>Approaching Adelaide, MacArthur was forced to compose himself. At the station, the gathered reporters were eager to know: He had fled the Philippines; yet his men were still there fighting. Did he have anything to say? MacArthur was tired and still distraught from Sutherland's news, "a lonely, angry man," according to his wife. But he wanted to send a message to his army and the people of the Philippines to let them know that they would not be forgotten. It was then that he delivered his famous words: "The President of the United States ordered me to break through the Japanese lines and proceed for Corregidor to Australia for the purpose, as I understand it, of organizing the American offensive against Japan, a primary object of which is the relief of the Philippines. I came through and I shall return."<br><br>On March 18, a day after he arrived in Australia, MacArthur learned the whole truth of America's "Germany first" policy: His U.S. ground troops would be limited to two divisions. He protested to General Marshall "No commander in American history has so failed of support as here."<br><br>MacArthur already felt as if Roosevelt had betrayed him in the Philippines. Now he felt betrayed again. His hope for a quick victory against the Japanese in New Guinea evaporated.<br><br>. . .<br><br>When MacArthur came to Australia, not only did he not have a great army to lead, but he was being asked to protect a country that was powerless to protect itself.

An appended glossary brings all the collective nouns together, defines them, and asks kids to guess why each is well suited to the corresponding animal. <strong>A lively picture book with plenty of classroom potential.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"'Do you ever wonder what animals do/ when they gather in groups of more than two?' queries the author in this <strong>clever contemplation of animal-centric collective nouns</strong>. Some of the text's rhyming questions are relatively straightforward ('Does a pack of wolves/ load up bags for vacation?// Does a cast of hawks/ get a standing ovation?'), while others are more complex: 'Would a labor of moles/ wear polka-dot ties// when it goes to work/ for a business of flies?' While this is basically a list of collective nouns, the rhythmic text is <strong>inventively and captivatingly composed</strong>, and the rhyme scheme is consistent and effective. Jago's digital illustrations are equally intriguing in their imaginative visualization of the text. The stylized figures and rich backgrounds in faux-linen texturing have subtle layers of patterning or color embellishing the art. Some amusingly depict the literal meaning of the collective noun, such as the 'stench' of skunks surrounded by a marbleized, translucent green fog as the 'band' (as in 'rock band') of gorillas holds its noses in dismay, or the sash-clad 'troop' of kangaroos selling Girl Scout-style boxes of cookies. A glossary listing each collective noun's more customary definition (e.g., 'labor (moles): to work hard') is also included. <strong>Language arts teachers as well as librarians will want to get their paws on this title.</strong>"&#x2015;<em>The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)<br><br><p>"Homonyms are used as mnemonic devices to help readers remember 'A Wild Gathering of Collective Nouns.' <strong>Cleverness abounds in Rosenthal's latest</strong>, from the title to the backmatter, which presents a glossary&#x2015;'ambush (tigers): an attack from a hiding place'&#x2015;asking children to guess why the words are appropriate for each animal group. <strong>The tongue-in-cheek text never falters in its rhythm and rhyme.</strong> 'Does a prickle of porcupines / feel any pain? / Can a flush of mallards / get sucked down the drain?' <strong>The illustrations are a perfect match for the text's wit.</strong> Three heavily bandaged porcupines lie in hospital beds, a sink between two of them. The convoluted pipes under the sink twist and turn across the gutter to discharge both water and mallards in an underground tunnel. A sleuth of bears, complete with magnifying glasses and fedoras, investigate a murder of crows. Three kangaroos belong to a troop, collecting dues and selling cookies while wearing sashes sewn with patches. Other highlights from the 33 featured animals include a shiver of sharks sporting scarves, a bouquet of pheasants arranged in a vase, a dancing rhumba of rattlesnakes and a lounge of lizards in the sun by the pool. Jago's illustrations walk the line between cartoon and realistic, his animals only anthropomorphized if the text suggests it. All are painted on canvas, which supplies a pleasing texture. <strong>Collective nouns have never been this much fun...or memorable.</strong>"&#x2015;starred, <em>Kirkus Reviews</em></p> (<i>Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Inner Journey: Views from the Christian Tradition (PARABOLA Anthology Series)</h2><p>For over three decades, those for whom religion is a path of discovery and questioning have found insight in the pages of <i>Parabola.</i> This thoughtful anthology collects the magazine&#x2019;s best writings on Christianity, featuring articles from Thomas Merton, Elaine Pagels, Philip Zaleski, Thomas Keating, and 20 other authors who vividly explore what it means to be a Christian.

The facts of history are scrupulously ignored and/or distorted. I was wondering if you could comment on imperialism then and now, interventions then and now. Specifically about Saigon in 1963 and 1964 and Kabul today?</p> <p>What happened in Vietnam in the early 1960s is gone from history. It was barely discussed at the time, and it&#x2019;s essentially disappeared. In 1954, there was a peace settlement between the United States and Vietnam. The United States regarded it as a disaster, refused to permit it to go forward, and established a client state in the South, which was a typical client state, carrying out torture, brutality, murders. By about 1960, the South Vietnamese government had probably killed seventy or eighty thousand people.1 The repression was so harsh that it stimulated an internal rebellion, which was not what the North Vietnamese wanted. They wanted some time to develop their own society. But they were sort of coerced by the southern resistance into at least giving it verbal support.</p> <p>By the time John F. Kennedy became involved in 1961, the situation was out of control. So Kennedy simply invaded the country. In 1962, he sent the U.S. Air Force to start bombing South Vietnam, using planes with South Vietnamese markings. Kennedy authorized the use of napalm, chemical warfare, to destroy the ground cover and crops. He started the process of driving the rural population into what were called &#x201c;strategic hamlets,&#x201d; essentially concentration camps, where people were surrounded by barbed wire, supposedly to protect them from the guerillas who the U.S. government knew perfectly well they supported. This &#x201c;pacification&#x201d; ultimately drove millions of people out of the countryside while destroying large parts of it. Kennedy also began operations against North Vietnam on a small scale. That was 1962.</p> <p>In 1963, the Kennedy administration got wind of the fact that the government of Ngo Dinh Diem it had installed in South Vietnam was trying to arrange negotiations with the North. Diem and his brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, were trying to negotiate a peace settlement. So the Kennedy liberals determined that they had to be thrown out. The Kennedy administration organized a coup in which the two brothers were killed and they put in their own guy, meanwhile escalating the war. Then came the assassination of President Kennedy. Contrary to a lot of mythology, Kennedy was one of the hawks in the administration to the very last minute. He did agree to proposals for withdrawal from Vietnam, because he knew the war was very unpopular here, but always with the condition of withdrawal after victory. Once we get victory, we can withdraw and let the client regime go.</p> <p>Actually, imperialism is an interesting term. The United States was founded as an empire. George Washington wrote in 1783 that &#x201c;the gradual extension of our settlements will as certainly cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire; both being beasts of prey, tho&#x2019; they differ in shape.&#x201d; Thomas Jefferson predicted that the &#x201c;backward&#x201d; tribes at the borders &#x201c;will relapse into barbarism and misery, lose numbers by war and want, and we shall be obliged to drive them, with the beasts of the forests into the Stony mountains.&#x201d;2 Once we don&#x2019;t need slavery anymore, we&#x2019;ll send the slaves back to Africa. And get rid of the Latins because they are an inferior race. We&#x2019;re the superior race of Anglo-Saxons. It&#x2019;s only to the benefit of everyone if we people the entire hemisphere.</p> <p><br>Copyright � 2012 by Noam Chomsky and David Barsamian<br></p></p><h2>A Spoonful of Poison (Agatha Raisin Mysteries, No 19)</h2><p><p><i>A Spoonful of Poison </i>continues the tradition in M.

His views as a humanist are at the heart of his work, which often depicts the pursuit of personal connections in spite of the restrictions of contemporary society. His humanist attitude is expressed in the non-fictional essay What I Believe (reprinted with two other humanist essays &#x2013; and an introduction and notes by Nicolas Walter &#x2013; as What I Believe, and other essays by the secular humanist publishers G. W. Foote &amp; Co. in 1999).</p><p>Forster's two best-known works, A Passage to India and Howards End, explore the irreconcilability of class differences. A Room with a View also shows how questions of propriety and class can make human connection difficult. The novel is his most widely read and accessible work, remaining popular long after its original publication. His posthumous novel Maurice explores the possibility of class reconciliation as one facet of a homosexual relationship.</p><p>Sexuality is another key theme in Forster's works. Some critics have argued that a general shift from heterosexual to homosexual love can be observed through the course of his writing career. The foreword to Maurice describes his struggle with his homosexuality, while he explored similar issues in several volumes of short stories. Forster's explicitly homosexual writings, the novel Maurice and the short story collection The Life to Come, were published shortly after his death.</p><p>Forster is noted for his use of symbolism as a technique in his novels, and he has been criticized (as by his friend Roger Fry) for his attachment to mysticism. One example of his symbolism is the wych elm tree in Howards End. The characters of Mrs. Wilcox in that novel and Mrs. Moore in A Passage to India have a mystical link with the past, and a striking ability to connect with people from beyond their own circles.</p></p><p></p><h2>All Music Guide to Jazz : The Definitive Guide to Jazz Music</h2><p>(Book).

They visit a fast-food restaurant, ride an elevator, climb into a skyscraper, visit a museum, and stay in a city apartment. Hugh meets a spoiled dog, cat, and parrot, all of whom are hostile to his intrusion into their comfortable home. They become friends, but insist that Hugh foil the bullying bulldog and crows in the neighborhood. True to his nature, Hugh will not be pushed around, but he knows that the best way is peaceful. He wisely teaches the pets the value of diplomacy and friendship before happily resuming life in his tree, having been enriched by his trip but glad to be home. Some readers may find the overwhelming sweetness and easy solutions cloying, but the book does continue to explore Hugh's delight in the world's wonders from a five-year-old's perspective. --Anne Osborn, Riverside Public<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the creators of Hugh Pine and Hugh Pine and the Good Place comes another fond story about that curmudgeonly, upright-walking porcupine. When Hugh's friend Mr. McTosh describes his vacation as "Something Else," (meaning something other than the dull, daily routines of non-vacation time), the porcupine decides that he, too, needs one. So he travels to New York City to stay with Mr. McTosh's sister (who keeps calling Hugh "nephew"), meeting the household pets, Fong and Nya, and a neighborhood bulldog appropriately named Bully. Hugh, Mr. McTosh and readers will be equally relieved to get back to the Maine woods . In this book, Hugh's wisdom lacks a little of the pungency on which his reputation is based. However, there are singular delights among the pages, not the least of which is Hugh's succinct clobbering of the Pekingese, Fong.

The story was about a bohemian girl&#x2019;s strange road trip to Elvis&#x2019;s Graceland with a mysterious cowboy. Carrie planned to turn it into a screenplay eventually. Because she felt a kinship with Kate, her main character, Carrie (being a free spirit and somewhat bohemian herself) decided to hit the road and take the same trip for research purposes.<br> <br>So she got out her maps, filled the gas tank in her Jeep, and headed south toward Memphis. She e-mailed me fresh pages of the story almost daily, along with tales of her own adventures on her journey to Graceland. As a side trip, Carrie visited our family&#x2019;s old stomping grounds in San Antonio, Texas, and Belleville, Arkansas, since the two of us were writing a play together based on my family, who came from those parts of the country.<br> <br>Carrie didn&#x2019;t live to finish either project. She died of cancer a little over a year later at the age of thirty-eight.<br> <br>This book has taken me on a bittersweet journey. When she was in the hospital for the last time, Carrie asked me to finish &#x201c;Sunrise in Memphis&#x201d; for her, which I haven&#x2019;t been able to do. Try as I might, the characters in the story were hers to write, not mine. Carrie&#x2019;s request had been living with me for over ten years when I finally figured out what I could do.<br> <br>Fortunately, I had saved all of the letters and e-mails we wrote to each other during her road trip to Memphis. In Part One of this book I&#x2019;ve combined that correspondence with my own memories. These include a few episodes I&#x2019;ve written about before, but I feel they bear repeating to round out the order of events. I&#x2019;ve also written here about Carrie&#x2019;s brave fight against her illness. Part Two is Carrie&#x2019;s story &#x201c;Sunrise in Memphis,&#x201d; which is fun to read in its own right, but also eerily echoes Carrie&#x2019;s journey.<br> <br>This book is my way of honoring her last request, bringing to the page many of Carrie&#x2019;s thoughts and feelings and also my own journey with her, including all the ups and downs in the early years (which got pretty bumpy when Carrie became a teenager).<br> <br>Carrie was widely known as a magnetic young woman with a stunning smile, an infectious laugh, a throaty voice, and the soul of a poet. She was someone who cared deeply for others, particularly for those less fortunate. Whenever a homeless person approached her, she would offer them a deal: five dollars if they told her their story. As you&#x2019;ll see, Carrie used those stories, and the personal narratives shared with her by everyone she met, as inspiration for her prose, her poetry, her music, her lyrics, and her acting. Carrie piled so much into her young life that one can only imagine what she would have tackled and accomplished in the second half.<br> <br>For myself, I hope you will get to know the daughter I loved and cherished. I can honestly say that just about everyone who knew Carrie loved her. Maybe that&#x2019;s because she loved them right back.<br> <br>I also hope I&#x2019;ve succeeded in bringing Carrie&#x2019;s essence to these pages. I treasure her words, and even after reading them again and again, each time I am grateful for the reminder that she has never left me.</p><h2>Brook and River Trouting: A Manual of Modern North Country Methods</h2><p>One of the first angling books to illustrate the materials required for fly patterns using colour photographs, this is an invaluable book giving detailed instruction on tying traditional North Country wet flies. The scarce first edition of this important book was privately published by the authors in 1916. This edition has a new introduction by Oliver Edwards "Edmonds &amp; Lee pulled off three masterstrokes for the flytyer, the most important being the photographs of the materials required for each fly. These were grouped alongside the photograph of each and every fly, thus at a stroke, eliminating any guesswork for those all important hackles. For instance, you can actually overlay your greyish barred feather from the under coverts of a woodcock's wing, and be certain you've got the correct one for the Winter Brown. Then there is the often perplexing problem of where to find the required hackle feather on the actual bird, the various covert feathers. This is shown in clear detail using a pair of well labelled snipe wings, both upper and under sides. Where feathers from other parts are called for - thigh, flank, base of tail, etc - there can be little error, the photographs have this clearly covered. The final masterstroke, I believe, is their inclusion of a colour chart of the full range of Pearsall's "Gossamer" silks. This is particularly important today when newcomers to tying North Country flies are striving to find original "Gossamers" on wooden spools (now becoming a "sport" of its own) or are forced to find alternative brands of pure silk thread."

To make matters more complicated, Jim has suddenly grown taller, stronger, and is sporting some very Troll-like hair, eyes, and teeth.

In it, an old man trapped Jim in a little glass bottle. Jim pushed against the cork stopper with all his might, but his tiny arms and legs were useless, despite the Daylight Armor supporting them. The old man finally popped the cork, poured Jim into a giant Food Magic 3000, and pressed the frapp� button. Jim thought he might have been screaming, but it was hard to tell over the whirring of the blender&#x2019;s oversized blades.<br> <br>When the Trollhunter woke up from his dream, it wasn&#x2019;t a scream that escaped his lips&#x2014;it was a flurry of bubbles. Jim&#x2019;s eyes snapped open, and he immediately felt cold pressure around his entire body. The good news was he wasn&#x2019;t trapped in a giant blender. But the bad news? Jim was trapped at the bottom of a giant body of water instead.<br> <br>He yelped in alarm, releasing another shimmering wave of bubbles. The Trollhunter watched the last of his oxygen float to the surface, some fifty feet above. Feeling his emptied lungs burn, Jim tried to swim. But the Daylight Armor encasing his body only weighed him down. He disturbed the muck beneath his leaden boots, kicking up a cloud of silt.<br> <br>Great, thought Jim. Now I&#x2019;m blind and drowning!<br> <br>Forcing himself not to panic, he reached for the Amulet on his chest and twisted it off. The metal breastplate to which it had been affixed vanished, as did the rest of the Daylight Armor. Now freed, and considerably lighter, Jim kicked his legs as hard as he could. He swam higher, even as his vision grew darker, and his head lighter. Jim felt the Amulet slip from his fingertips. He watched the device sink away, along with his hopes of survival.<br> <br>The Trollhunter focused his last bit of willpower and reached out toward the Amulet. A bright blue glow appeared below and shot toward Jim like a rocket. He grabbed onto the Amulet as it passed, and the magic disc dragged him up and out of the water with a splash.<br> <br>Now flying over the surface, Jim gasped for air. His daze lifted, and he thought he saw a pine forest backlit by the dusk&#x2014;right before the Amulet reached the top of its arc. With another yelp, Jim started to fall. He crashed into the water again, only this part was much shallower. The Trollhunter trudged out of the lake and collapsed on its shore. Still catching his breath, he looked at the Amulet in his hand and said, &#x201c;Would it have killed you to let me down gently?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ting! the Amulet chimed in response.<br> <br>Jim shook the water from his ears. He looked at the canopy of silhouetted trees before recognizing the manmade dam at the opposite end of the lake.<br> <br>I know this place! Jim thought. Lake Arcadia Oaks. Tobes and I used to go camping here back when we were Junior Mole Scouts.<br> <br>A breeze blew through the pines, making Jim shiver. He wrapped his arms around his soaked body and lamented how this wasn&#x2019;t the first watery grave he&#x2019;d avoided this week. But such narrow escapes were all too common for Jim lately. Ever since Merlin&#x2019;s Amulet transformed him into the first human Trollhunter, Jim&#x2019;s world had flipped from ordinary to extraordinary&#x2014;not necessarily in a good way. Nothing but madness, misery, and mayhem followed. And that was just at high school. Jim didn&#x2019;t even want to think about all the near-beheadings, trials by combat, and exiles to infernal dimensions that came with his part-time job.<br> <br>As he wrung out his sopping wet sweater, he tried to recall how he wound up at the bottom of a lake in the first place. The last thing the Trollhunter remembered was how Merlin prepared some potion in the Food Magic 3000 blender Jim&#x2019;s mom got him for his last birthday.<br> <br>Well, hopefully not my last birthday, Jim mentally corrected himself. Maybe I should just call it my most recent one. I&#x2019;d like to live past my teens, if possible!<br> <br>But the thought did little to cheer Jim. Because it then made him think of the whole reason behind Merlin&#x2019;s elixir: the Eternal Night. Jim&#x2019;s Troll friends, Blinky and AAARRRGGHH!!!, had gone over the bullet points of this prophesied end of the world: If Gunmar used Merlin&#x2019;s Staff of Avalon to restore Morgana to life, the crazy witch would bring about an everlasting eclipse. With no sunlight to turn them to stone, the evil Gumm-Gumms would dominate the entire planet, above and below. And the good Trolls and humans&#x2014;humans like Jim&#x2019;s mom and best friends, Toby and Claire&#x2014;well, they&#x2019;d be hunted to extinction.<br> <br>&#x201c;If they&#x2019;re even alive now,&#x201d; Jim muttered, draining the water from his sneakers.<br> <br>His memory gradually came back, and Jim felt a surge of worry for his loved ones. His mom, Barbara, had gone missing earlier that day, and Toby and Claire set out to search for her. But Jim still hadn&#x2019;t heard back from them, and that was hours ago&#x2014;before the sun went down and Merlin cornered his latest Trollhunter with the strange brew he&#x2019;d concocted.<br> <br>Jim reached for his phone to check for any texts or voicemails. But his pockets were empty. He slapped his forehead in frustration, and the jolt jogged the missing bits of his recollection. Jim had left his cell by the bathroom sink, after he&#x2019;d filled the tub with water and poured in the elixir. After he&#x2019;d donned the Daylight Armor and submerged himself in the bath. After Merlin had told him that, to stop the Eternal Night, Jim would have to become both Troll and Hunter. . . .<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever that means,&#x201d; Jim mumbled with another shiver.<br> <br>He considered the darkening woods around him. Lake Arcadia Oaks was only a few miles outside town. Jim figured he could walk it. Especially since he couldn&#x2019;t use his ride-sharing app without a phone. But if Jim hustled, he might even make it back in time to whip up breakfast for his mom and friends&#x2014;because they had to be okay, they just had to&#x2014;and call out Merlin for the liar he was. After all, that elixir was supposed to transform Jim into something bigger and better, not teleport him way out to the boonies.<br> <br>Jim soon heard a whining that was not his own. This one came from between a few of the tall, black pines. He walked over and peered into the woods. Jim heard another whine and spotted its source just a few feet ahead.<br> <br>A small wolf pup with floppy ears and a gray-and-white coat lay between two fallen logs. Some old fishing line was tangled around his paws like a plastic net. And the more the puppy struggled, the more it constricted around him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hang on, little guy,&#x201d; Jim said softly.<br> <br>He knelt and gradually extricated the young wolf from the web of carelessly discarded garbage. As soon as he was free, the pup ran away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, you&#x2019;re welcome?&#x201d; said Jim in annoyance.<br> <br>The pup stopped in his tracks and looked back. Jim stayed crouched and slowly offered out his hand. The wolf&#x2019;s big ears piqued in curiosity as he crept back and gave Jim a few tentative sniffs.<br> <br>&#x201c;There you go,&#x201d; said Jim in a sweet, singsong tone.<br> <br>Feeling more at ease, the small wolf sat on his haunches and looked up at the Trollhunter. He started petting the pup, scratching behind his ear and saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d be worried that your mama is sizing me up for dinner right about now, but I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;re all alone out here. Me too.&#x201d;<br> <br>The pup cocked his head at Jim and started barking, as if in answer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Geez, listen to Sir Barks-a-Lot over here,&#x201d; Jim joked.<br> <br>Another gust blew through the woods, and the trees creaked around them. Jim looked up at the sky, and saw moonlight filtering between the growing storm clouds. He stood up and said, &#x201c;Well, later, Sir Barks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jim started heading to where he thought the main road was located. He&#x2019;d only walked a few feet, when he heard another bark. Turning, Jim saw the pup behind him, tail wagging.<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh, you probably don&#x2019;t wanna go where I&#x2019;m headed,&#x201d; Jim said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what their feeling is about dogs, but Trolls sure think cats are delicious.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Trollhunter resumed on his way, and Sir Barks followed. Jim tried to shoo him away, saying &#x201c;Go on, skedaddle! Run free! Live la vida lupa!&#x201d;<br> <br>The wolf didn&#x2019;t budge an inch.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seriously, Sir Barks, you&#x2019;re better off keeping your distance,&#x201d; Jim pleaded, pulling the Amulet from his pocket. &#x201c;Ever since this thing found me, my life&#x2019;s gotten pretty unpleasant&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>High above them, the thunderclouds parted, revealing a low, full moon&#x2014;a Hunter&#x2019;s Moon. Jim&#x2019;s body suddenly seized with agony. It felt like his every nerve ending was on fire. He fell over, dropping the Amulet and startling Sir Barks. The wolf pup ran back to the trees. Jim was grateful, but not for the intense pain shooting through his muscles and bones that made his jaws clench, his eyes water.<br> <br>Through his tears, Jim thought he saw something approach from the woods. It wasn&#x2019;t Sir Barks. It was a large, lumbering figure that soon became two. Jim couldn&#x2019;t tell if the double vision was due to his bleary eyes or if one body had been walking behind another. He fumbled for the Amulet, but his hands couldn&#x2019;t coordinate, wouldn&#x2019;t respond.<br> <br>It was almost as if the Trollhunter&#x2019;s body wasn&#x2019;t his own anymore.</p><h2>The Land Was Everything: Letters from an American Farmer</h2><p>The author of Fields Without Dreams offers a firsthand perspective on a farmer&#39;s continual struggle against drought, disease, insects, rodents, government bureaucracy, financial overload, and other challenges confronting the modern farmer and explains how these difficulties promote such qualities as independence, stoicism, and resolution.</p><p>Victor Davis Hanson, a California professor of classical history and a sixth-generation orchard-keeper, revisits an old tradition in American letters, writing social criticism from an agrarian point of view that takes the farmer to be the foundation of any democracy worthy of the name. That Jeffersonian argument is not widely aired these days, apart from the essays of Wendell Berry and a few like-minded nature writers, and it takes on a specifically political force in Hanson's thoughtful, sometimes angry meditations on the decline of farming and the virtuous values that farming once instilled.<p> The enemies of farming are many, Hanson declares. They number not only drought, insects, fire, and fungi, but also political leaders who are content to watch the fertile countryside be carved into arid seas of look-alike homes, housing consumers who demand factory-issued foods in all seasons. Their demands are met--and, barring disaster, will continue to be met--by corporate agriculture, which, Hanson holds, values appearance over taste and prizes short-term profits over the long-term health of the land. The ascendance of that corporate system of food production means that fewer and fewer small farms can survive, and that agriculture will seem an ever more alien enterprise to the coming generations, conducted far off in the hinterland, "the corporate void where no sane man wishes to live."</p><p> This all means, Hanson suggests, that the farmer of old who knew how to fix tractors and fences, how to wage war on predators while shunning the use of poisons, and how to live self-reliantly is a thing of the past. The disappearance of that American archetype is all to the bad. As Hanson writes, "We have lost our agrarian landscape and with it the insurance that there would be an autonomous, outspoken, and critical group of citizens eager to remind us of the current fads and follies of the day." Resounding with righteous fury and good common sense, his book is a call to turn back the clock and set a more civilized table. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Victor Davis Hanson is Professor of Classics at California State University&#39;s Fresno campus.</p><h2>The Magic Flute</h2><p>Enter a magical world of monster serpents, mysterious ladies, and flying machines where giant flowers and butterflies the size of birds abound. It is here, amidst a lush wood and within a dark labyrinthine castle that an unforgettable cast of characters gathers and a magical story of good versus evil unfolds. Readers will thrill as Prince Tamino strives to save Princess Pamina from the wicked Queen of the Night and the Chancellor Monostatos. Accompanied by Papageno, the birdcatcher, and a magic flute to ward off evil, Tamino and Pamina must overcome thundering waterfalls and walls of fire to save their kingdom from darkness and live happily ever after. <p>Illustrated with the glorious paintings of Peter Malone, this enchanting retelling of Mozart's famous opera paired with an audio CD is sure to delight lovers of fairytales and music alike.</p></p><p>Mozart's last opera, the simultaneously comic and serious fairy tale <i>The Magic Flute</i> (<i>Die Zauberfloete</i>), is as problematic as anything in the medium. Some deplore it for its perceived sexism and racism; some deplore it for its arguably goofy plot. "Depending on your perspective," writes David Foil in his essay in this book, it "is either the silliest opera ever written or a work of profound insight that happens to be dressed in the trappings of a cartoon." That it is Mozart's sublime music that ennobles something meant to be merely a short-lived popular entertainment is not in question. <p> This volume, issued by Black Dog Opera Library, puts together Foil's essay, lots of pictures, a complete libretto (with running commentary) in English and German, and a classic recording on two compact discs in one comfortably priced hardcover package. It is a fine introduction to what remains a great opera, goofy plot or no. (And Bellini's plots aren't even goofier?) It is worth buying just for the now out-of-print EMI/Angel 1972 (remastered in 1987) recording, contained on two very long-playing CDs, found inside the front and back covers of the book. The dialogue portions work better in this version than in most recordings. Anneliese Rothenberger is an appealing Pamina, and Walter Berry is a delightful Papageno. Edda Moser nails the difficult music of the Queen of Night, while Kurt Moll is our day's definitive Sarastro. Wolfgang Sawallisch, brisk and never lugubrious, conducts his soloists and the Bavarian State Opera Chorus and Orchestra with total certainty.</p>The ultimate gift for opera lovers, the irresistible illustrated libretto pairs Davide Pizzigoni&#39;s engaging images with J. D. McClatchy&#39;s witty new translation and a music CD of the rare 1937 recording of Arturo Toscanini conducting the Vienna Philharmonic.</p><h2>I Drink Therefore I Am: A Philosopher&#39;s Guide to Wine</h2><p>We are familiar with the medical opinion that a daily glass of wine is good for the health and also the rival opinion that any more than a glass or two will set us on the road to ruin. Whether or not good for the body, Scruton argues, wine, drunk in the right frame of mind, is definitely good for the soul. And there is no better accompaniment to wine than philosophy. By thinking with wine, you can learn not only to drink in thoughts but to think in draughts.<br><br>This good-humoured book offers an antidote to the pretentious clap-trap that is written about wine today and a profound apology for the drink on which civilisation has been founded.<br><br><em>In vino veritas</em>.</p><p>Professor Roger Scruton is Resident Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, Washington and Senior Research Fellow at Blackfriars Hall, Oxford.

It is up to Joss to lead his Slayer team, and through their detective work, they discover that there are actually four vampire brothers who are on the killing rampage. Joss must use all his skill to save the innocent people of New York City from the murderers. Joss's status as a Slayer depends on it. <br><br>The Slayer Chronicles can be read alongside The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod or entirely on their own. This second installment gives readers even more insight into the nightmares that drive Joss the Slayer.</p><p>Heather Brewer doesn&#39;t believe in happy endings, unless they involve blood. An anti-bullying advocate and dynamic public speaker, Ms. Brewer has connected personally with her fans, who call themselves her Minions. She lives near St. Louis, Missouri, with her husband and two children.Gr 6-8-In Brewer's sequel (2012) to First Kill (2011, both Dial), teen vampire slayer Joss McMillan is getting one second chance to prove himself and his loyalty to the Slayer Society after betraying his team by taking a secret assignment. Still reeling from failing at his solo mission, Joss is plagued by feelings of inadequacy and nightmares of his dead sister. Now, while he's feeling his lowest, Joss has been assigned to lead the team to kill a vampire serial killer who has been plaguing New York City. Joss utilizes the skills he learned during Slayer training and helps to determine that there may not be just one serial killer picking off victims in the city. Delving deeper into the Slayer world, Joss begins to discover that, just as with humans, there are many different things that drive vampires and that things may not ever be as black and white as they seem. Narrator Alexander Cendese does a good job channeling Joss' inner turmoil as he deals with a scary assignment and the guilt from being unable to save his younger sister's life. Both pacing and tone match the emotional and tense scenes as Joss hunts in a new urban environment. Numerous flashbacks and references to Brewer's "The Chronicles of Vladimir Tod" series may have listeners checking out the author's first five-book set.

Autumn 1952, and seven-year-old Luke helps his family pick cotton on the Arkansas farm that they rent. Times are hard, tension is high, and he finds himself keeping secrets that threaten the crop and will change the life of his family forever.</p><p>Ever since he published <i>The Firm</i> in 1991, John Grisham has remained the undisputed champ of the legal thriller. With <i>A Painted House</i>, however, he strikes out in a new direction. As the author is quick to note, this novel includes "not a single lawyer, dead or alive," and readers will search in vain for the kind of lowlife machinations that have been his stock-in-trade. Instead, Grisham has delivered a quieter, more contemplative story, set in rural Arkansas in 1952. It's harvest time on the Chandler farm, and the family has hired a crew of migrant Mexicans and "hill people" to pick 80 acres of cotton. A certain camaraderie pervades this bucolic dream team. But it's backbreaking work, particularly for the 7-year-old narrator, Luke: "I would pick cotton, tearing the fluffy bolls from the stalks at a steady pace, stuffing them into the heavy sack, afraid to look down the row and be reminded of how endless it was, afraid to slow down because someone would notice."<p> What's more, tensions begin to simmer between the Mexicans and the hill people, one of whom has a penchant for bare-knuckles brawling. This leads to a brutal murder, which young Luke has the bad luck to witness. At this point--with secrets, lies, and at least one knife fight in the offing--the plot begins to take on that familiar, Grisham-style momentum. Still, such matters ultimately take a back seat in <i>A Painted House</i> to the author's evocation of time and place. This is, after all, the scene of his boyhood, and Grisham waxes nostalgic without ever succumbing to deep-fried sentimentality. Meanwhile, his account of Luke's Baptist upbringing occasions some sly (and telling) humor: </p><blockquote> I'd been taught in Sunday school from the day I could walk that lying would send you straight to hell. No detours. No second chances. Straight into the fiery pit, where Satan was waiting with the likes of Hitler and Judas Iscariot and General Grant. Thou shalt not bear false witness, which, of course, didn't sound exactly like a strict prohibition against lying, but that was the way the Baptists interpreted it. </blockquote> Whether Grisham will continue along these lines, or revert to the judicial shark tank for his next book, is anybody's guess. But <i>A Painted House</i> suggests that he's perfectly capable of telling an involving story with nary a subpoena in sight. <i>--James Marcus</i>Dear Friends: <p><i>A Painted House</i> is not a legal thriller. In fact, there is not a single lawyer, dead or alive, in this story. Nor are there judges, trials, courtrooms, conspiracies or nagging social issues. </p><p><i>A Painted House</i> is a work of fiction. It was inspired by my childhood in rural Arkansas. The setting is reasonably accurate, though historical accuracy should not be taken too seriously. One or two of these characters may actually have lived and breathed on this earth, though I know them only through family lore, which in my family is a most unreliable source. One or two of these events may indeed have taken place, though I've heard so many different versions of these events that I believe none of them myself. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>John Grisham</p></p><h2>Left Hand of Darkness</h2><p>Winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards A groundbreaking work of science fiction, The Left Hand of Darkness tells the story of a lone human emissary to Winter, an alien world whose inhabitants can change their gender. His goal is to facilitate Winter&#39;s inclusion in a growing intergalactic civilization. But to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own views and those of the completely dissimilar culture that he encounters. Embracing the aspects of psychology, society, and human emotion on an alien world, The Left Hand of Darkness stands as a landmark achievement in the annals of intellectual science fiction.</p><p>Genly Ai is an emissary from the human galaxy to Winter, a lost, stray world. His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise.<p> If there were a canon of classic science fiction, <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> would be included without debate. Certainly, no science fiction bookshelf may be said to be complete without it. But the real question: is it fun to read? It is science fiction of an earlier time, a time that has not worn particularly well in the genre. <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> was a groundbreaking book in 1969, a time when, like the rest of the arts, science fiction was awakening to new dimensions in both society and literature. But the first excursions out of the pulp tradition are sometimes difficult to reread with much enjoyment. Rereading <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i>, decades after its publication, one feels that those who chose it for the Hugo and Nebula awards were right to do so, for it truly does stand out as one of the great books of that era. It is immensely rich in timeless wisdom and insight.</p><p> <i>The Left Hand of Darkness</i> is science fiction for the thinking reader, and should be read attentively in order to properly savor the depth of insight and the subtleties of plot and character.

James, Britain also can boast a lesser-known crime matron like Simpson, the extremely capable creator of the Inspector Luke Thanet series. In his 11th puzzle (after Doomed to Die ), Thanet's beat remains the town of Sturrenden, his milieu the upper middle classes, his sleuthing style understated and shrewdly intuitive--when he isn't beset by such family problems as his teenage daughter's posh new boyfriend. The inspector finds a diversion of sorts at a local fete hosted by the prominent Fairleigh family. But then death strikes: someone uses a pillow to suffocate the clan's tough old matriarch only days after she suffers a stroke. Suspects include the immediate family--a son in politics, a daughter-in-law mourning her baby's death, a timid sister--and the usual collection of odd servants beloved by British crime writers. Simpson offers only a handful of possible perpetrators and only a few murder options in a scenario limited to high teas, socializing and typically unruly British weather. Yet she works wonders within that narrow framework.

We don&#x2019;t have to lose the fight. In fact, we can win if we understand the root of the problem and what Christians have done from the beginning to beat it. <em>Our Favorite Sins</em> shines a much-needed light in our lives&#x2019; dark corners and reveals the time-tested methods for getting victory over sin.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are you tyrannized by your own desires?</strong></p><p><strong>If you are breathing, your answer is probably yes. </strong></p><p><strong>The question is: <em>What are you going to do about it?</em></strong> </p><p>With more than thirty years of pastoral experience, Todd D. Hunter knows that most people&#x2014;himself included&#x2014;struggle every day with temptation. All too often, we fail and fall, and some of us are at our wit&#x2019;s end, utterly defeated. What do we do to get a grip on the sin in our life and live like God wants?&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;s good news: despite all our failures and shameful &#x201c;moments after,&#x201d; there really is a way out, a way forward, and a way that draws us closer to the life that God desires for us.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Our Favorite Sins</em>, Hunter cracks open the problem of temptation and points to practical, biblically based, time-tested solutions. First revealing the role played by our disordered desires, Hunter shows how different temptations trip us up and how we can resist and overcome them, even if we&#x2019;ve fallen prey to them for decades. Victory starts with reordering our desires, and the church has given us the tools for the job. Hunter shows us how to use them and start beating the temptations that so often beat us.&nbsp;</p><p>Informed by exclusive research from the Barna Group, <em>Our Favorite Sins</em> offers a view that works for any believer wherever they are and no matter how big the battle they&#x2019;re fighting.</p></p><p>Todd Hunter is a bishop for The Anglican Mission in the Americas and is the founding pastor of Holy Trinity Anglican Church in Costa Mesa, CA.

Best remembered for such classic crime novels as <i>Murder on the Orient Express</i>, <i>And Then There Were None</i>, and <i>Death on the Nile</i>, her works have been cherished by generations of readers. Christie, however, was also a master of the shorter crime story and this volume collects some of her finest short stories. Each of these thirty-nine stories features one of Christie's famous detectives - Miss Marple, Hercule Poirot, Parker Pyne, and Harley Quin - in some of their most baffling and intriguing cases, as these ingenious Christie tales show how satisfying and compelling the crime short story can be.</p><p>Agatha Christie's&nbsp;career spanned more than fifty years and included eighty books as well as fourteen plays. Declared the "champion deceiver of our time" (<i>New York Times</i>), she is best known in the U.S. for her classic novel <i>And Then There Were None</i> as well as her novels featuring Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple.

Instead, here's a cooking romance as it might be imagined by the Lifetime network's producers: skinny daughter of WASPy Los Angeles veterinarian and Jewish beauty grows up to play C.J. on the 1980s TV series <i>Matt Houston</i>; marries Duke Vincent, the dashing producer who cast her in the role... and they eat happily ever after in their opulent California kitchen. Vincent isn't a professional chef, and some of her recipe instructions are downright strange (an entire head of garlic simmers in tomato sauce for only five minutes; another sauce described as "marinara"&#x2014;traditionally meatless&#x2014;owes its punch to pepperoni). But grandmother Yette knew her latkes; dad Jack was a shish kebab master; and Duke's Italian-American staples are easy and appealing. Too bad we don't hear more from housekeeper Lucy Ramos, whose two salsa recipes are tantalizing. Vincent's style is more girlfriendy than informational&#x2014;every recipe includes several exclamations of "Delicious!"&#x2014;and the photographs include more publicity head shots than actual dishes. Serious foodies will find little of interest here, but Vincent's enthusiasm for the pleasures of table and family in the midst of life in the TV fast lane is likable enough. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The best ones are delineations of what happens in real life, in the community, and in the individual's mental processes." --from the Introduction <p>This pocket-size collection of sayings and stories from real life, and from the author's observations of our mental processes, is a perfect gift book. It's contemporary, fun to read--like a splash of ice water for the mind.</p></p><p>As the urgency of our global situation becomes apparent, more and more readers are turning to the books of Idries Shah (1924-1996) as a way to train new capacities and new ways of thinking. Shah has been described as "the most significant worker adapting classical spiritual thought to the modern world." <p>Shah was educated in both the East and West, by private tutors and through wide-ranging travel and personal encounters - the series of journeys which characterize Sufi education and development. In keeping with Sufi tradition, his life was essentially one of service. His knowledge and interests appeared limitless, and his activities and accomplishments took place in many different countries and in numerous fields of endeavor. </p><p>Shah was Director of Studies of the Institute for Cultural Research, an educational organization sponsoring interdisciplinary and crosscultural studies of human thought; a founding member of the Club of Rome; a Governor of the Royal Humane Society and the Royal Hospital and Home for Incurables; and the founder of publishing house Octagon Press. </p><p>Shah's landmark book, "The Sufis", invited readers to approach Sufi ideas and test them out. The evident and common sense made it clear that here was a sane, authoritative voice in the wilderness of the gobbledegookish mysticism of the sixties. The lively, contemporary books on traditional psychologies, literature, philosophy and Sufi thought that followed established a broad historical and cultural context for Sufi thought and action. These have so far sold over 15 million copies in 12 languages worldwide and have been awarded many prizes. They have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New Yorker, The Times, The Tribune, The Telegraph, and numerous other international journals and newspapers. </p><p>University and college courses throughout the world are employing Shah's books, or works based on them, in a wide variety of disciplines including sociology, psychology and literature. </p><p>In 1969, Idries Shah was awarded the Dictionary of International Biography's Certificate of Merit for Distinguished Service to Human Thought. Other honors included a Two Thousand Men of Achievement award (1971), Six First Prizes awarded by the UNESCO International Book Year (1972), and the International Who's Who in Poetry's Gold Medal for Poetry (1975). </p><p>According to his obituary in the London Daily Telegraph "it is impossible to assess his influence, and his legacy is incalculable". </p><p>He was, it is said, the Sufi Teacher of the Age. </p><p>"The most interesting books in the English language." Saturday Review </p><p>"A major psychological and cultural event of our time." Psychology Today </p><p>"One is immediately forced to use one's mind in a new way." New York Times </p><p>The instrumental function of Shah's work is now well established among people from all walks of life. Stockbrokers, scientists, lawyers, managers, writers, physicians, and diplomats have found Shah's literature for human development "extraordinary". </p><p>"It presents a blueprint of the human mental structure." Robert Ornstein, Ph.D. </p><p>"Extremely useful in teaching students about management and computers."

To get through to mankind, you must promise happiness to those who are sad, and threaten with distress those who are happy. They are all to be exposed to tension, anxiety, joy and repetition. They must be induced to think, when they are hypocrites, that they are honest and straightforward. You will also sanctify self-indulgence, by making people enjoy suffering and then tell them that they are not enjoying it, because it is a punishment." </p><p>"But this is terrible!" exclaimed the celestial ones.

Inspired by nature, his schemes demonstrate how form, texture, light and movement are as important as colour. The manual shows the essential building blocks of this style in special planting palettes, then explains how to combine them in schemes that will bring vibrancy to the garden throughout the year.</p><p>When your new gardening bible comes with chapters entitled "Birth," "Life," and "Death," you know you're in trouble. But be brave, turn to those chapters, and in some very practical little essays on planting, you'll uncover the very down-to-earth principle from which Piet Oudolf's radical reinvention of gardening is based: plants die. <p> In the traditional mixed border, shrubs, climbers, perennials, bulbs, and annuals defy mortality; when one plant passes its best, there's always another in the wings, waiting to grab the eye. But such borders have very little impact: there is too little at any one time to hold one's attention. Oudolf wonders why we fight the unavoidable. Why not create borders that bring out the beauty of plants throughout their natural cycles?</p><p> Oudolf also thinks our obsession with color is another deadening influence on current gardening practice. Plants have form: leaves, flower heads, and stems have beauty and variety, too, and last far longer than any bloom. Why not create gardens that use the whole plant, not just its genitals? This, as you've probably already guessed, is a recipe for perennials, and without any of that anxious autumn rush to cut down those perfectly lovely bare stems and seed heads. </p><p> With these versatile plants, Oudolf would have us all create gardens that change month by month, week by week, even day by day. It's a radical, beautiful vision that's absurdly easy to achieve. In <i>Designing with Plants</i>, Noel Kingsbury has done a terrific job of bringing Oudolf's work within reach of the rest of us. <i>--Simon Ings, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>A wealth of color photos demonstrates unique &amp; spectacular garden design ideas.</p><h2>When the Sacred Ginmill Closes</h2><p>Already at work on two dangerous cases, Matthew Scudder, the down-and-out, hard-drinking ex-cop, becomes personally involved when the wife of a friend is brutally murdered</p><p>Lawrence Block is a four-time winner of the Edgar Award and was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America.

Her voice is evenly modulated, and she introduces new story elements slowly, accelerating when there is repetition or a growing sense of urgency.

That experience may go far beyond the object itself.</p><p>Genette situates art within the broad realm of human practices, extending from the fine arts of music, painting, sculpture, and literature to humbler but no less fertile fields such as haute couture and the culinary arts. His discussion touches on a rich array of examples and is bolstered by an extensive knowledge of the technology involved in producing and disseminating a work of art, regardless of whether that dissemination is by performance, reproduction, printing, or recording. Moving beyond examples, Genette proposes schemata for thinking about the different manifestations of a work of art. He also addresses the question of the artwork's duration and mutability.</p></p><p>According to Gerard Genette, works of art can have two modes of existence: immanence and transcendence.Translated by G.M. Goshgarian.<p>G�rard Genette teaches at l'Ecole des Hautes en Science Sociales, Paris. He is the author of many books, including three published in translation by Cornell. G. M. Goshgarian is the translator of several books from Cornell, including The Jew and the Other and Three Women in Dark Times: Edith Stein, Hannah Arendt, Simone Weil.</p></p><h2>Glenna Goodacre Sculpture</h2><p>In hew own words, sculptor Glenna Goodacre describes the inspiration for, and creation of, her unforgettable bronze sculptures. From the timid beginning of a six-inch study of her daughter Jill, Goodacre went on to sculpt over 40 important portrait commisions including the standing figure of president Ronald W. Reagan at the National Cowboy Heritage Center and at the Regan Presidential Library. This book features photographs of her most high-profile pieces, but many little-known works are included as well. Her most popular monument is the Vietnam Women&#39;s Memorial on the National Mall. Her largest public installation is the Irish Memorial at Penn&#39;s Landing in Philadelphia. Goodacre&#39;s smallest work is the fromt of the Sacagawea golden U.S. Dollar, first minted in 2000. Previously unpublished studies from the design process for the coin are also represented. A photographic survey of the artist&#39;s engaging sculptures, along with snapshots and anecdotes, covers the wide scope of her colorful career.</p><p>A representational painter who turned to figurative sculpture in 1969, Glenna Goodacre is one of America&#39;s most beloved and acomplished artists. Convincing expression and lively composition are hallmarks of her bronzes, ranging in size from tiny studies to heroic monuments. Her sculptural pieces are in corporate, private, municipal, and museum collections throughout the U.S. and around the world. She continues to sculpt daily in her studio in Santa Fe, New Mexico where she has lived sinice 1983.</p><h2>True Believer, The</h2><p><p>&#x201c;[Eric Hoffer] is a student of extraordinary perception and insight.

She resides in Fort Worth, Texas.Chapter 1<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Return of the Native</i><br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Max Kinsella looked like a surreal figure lost in a garishly vacant Dali landscape. Temple couldn't believe her eyes.<br>Nor could her mind assemble several clear but alien impressions into a recognizable image...neon-storm, carnival-midway Hawaiian shirt. Oil-slick rainbow sunshades...dark, virtual-reality lenses locking the wearer into an intimated vast but hidden world. Height like the Eiffel Tower: familiar but looming larger than memory.<br>She was viewing not Max Kinsella, but Max Headroom, some berserk computer-image accident and traveling freak show. Kaleidoscopic Technicolor Hologram Man. Unreal, man. Unreal.<br>The seashore roared in Temple's ears. She sensed her own space, time and particular place in such sharp but distant clarity that it too had become a dislocated Dali landscape, seen but not felt. Not truly comprehended.<br>Well-corseted Victorian ladies, she guessed, would have swooned by now. The only buttressing piece of clothing holding Temple together at the moment was the soft sash of her martial arts gi, and it was no excuse for suffering an attack of the vapors.<br>She became aware of her bare feet planted on the fuzzy comfort of her fake goat-hair rug. At the same instant, she became even more alert to her hatred of ever being seen at such a childish disadvantage.<br>And then, despite the ludicrous shock of Max's reappearance, and his appearance, reality shattered her Technicolor daze like a fist smashing a stained-glass window.<br>She heard the eternal, prosaic hum of the air conditioner, and began to recognize again the bland familiarity of her domestic terrain. She even began to recall Max being as normal a part of this interior decor as she was. She began to believe he was there, as she still was. That this time it was really, really Max. That he was...alive.<br>A thrum of relief overrode numb disbelief.<br>Then another emotion came roaring out from the icebox of time-frozen emotions in which she had stored Max with the wistful care of someone preserving a prom-night corsage.<br>A muscular emotion, part fire and part tempered steel, it had a hot, coal-fire heart and a one-track mind. Its long-dampered engine began racing, chug-chugging with impatience, building up a head of steam in countertime to the shock-slowed beat of her heart.<br>The memory engine was gathering speed and sweeping her into its impetuous train. She saw the past--their past--glide by in stately panorama.<br>Meeting at the Guthrie Theatre. That night's magic show--prestidigitation in the heart of darkness--the stage a velvet-black hole lit by the spotlights' cyclic fireworks. Walking beside the lamplight-dappled water in Loring Park in a lukewarm summer night. Leaving Minneapolis. Landing in Las Vegas so lost in each other they were like shell-shocked aliens on terra infirma.<br>Electra, the Circle Ritz, the Goliath and more magic shows in the dark, more days in the light, more nights in black satin and falling stars afloat on water....Azure days, quicksilver nights.<br>Temple was now a mere passenger aboard the locomotive of her own emotions, drawn along by one particular, as-yet unnameable sensation. She leaned out the train window and tilted her head to read the passing sign: the town of Joy in the state of Disbelief. Utter, driving, unstoppable joy.<br>The train steamed forward, sure of itself, carving a path through space and time, back to the future, escaping the past and tearing into the present. Everything else slipped away like air. The engine was climbing the steepest grade of incredulity, penetrating the darkest tunnel of doubt, ready to huff and puff across the widest chasm of uncertainty, ready to overleap any chasm, whether a bridge stretched beneath it or not....<br>"Max--" Temple heard her voice whisper. <i>You're alive</i>, her mind shouted.<br>Max didn't seem to hear either his spoken name or her nameless emotions. Maybe the pistons of her joy were pounding too loudly. Then he spoke, too.<br>"Who's the blond?"<br>Temple frowned at words as indecipherable as vernacular Martian. Nonsense syllables. Why would Max speak gobbledegook at such a moment?<br>"You're alive," she whispered, still lagging behind real time.<br><i>Who's the blond</i>? What blond? Some woman he wanted to saw in half, some blonde magician's assistant? Christie Brinkley? Huh?<br>Then the present reasserted itself in flash cards of detail. Temple saw herself passing through the past twenty-four hours as if watching a secret videotape of her every movement. Then she understood.<br>The parquet floor of her apartment shuddered and became so solid it hurt. Sunlight lancing through the open French door that framed Max's bizarre silhouette made her eyes water.<br>Her train of joy derailed with a sickening crash, a jack-knifing, twisting tangle of each car in its long train. Passengers named Trust and Hope and Love were cast out upon the surreal countryside like so many dice gone awry.<br>Yet everything collapsed in slow motion, like all disasters both physical and psychic. She had one split second to mourn the ruined scene, to count the dead and to inspect the walking wounded, particularly herself. Then her strange travelog of emotion ended with her at home.<br>She studied Max's Technicolor facade, knowing the man behind it, inside it, and not knowing him at all. With one cold question, he had cast himself again into the farthest, protective deep freeze of her emotions. Fresh damage smashed Temple's train wreck of joy into smaller pieces. His words, so distant, so judging, struck her heart to the hilt, a long, Arthurian sword thrust so deep it might never be drawn out. If only she <i>were</i> stone...<br>A new emotion surfaced through an ocean of hurt, and it struck back.<br>"Are your eyes really green?" she said, just as flatly.<br>So there they stood, after all this time, asking idiot questions that could only be answered with anger and self-justification.<br>Max stood unmoving, as he in turn struggled to decode her remark. Then he took off his sunglasses, folded and hung them from the dreadful shirt's breast pocket.<br>His eyes were still green, Temple saw, but were they <i>really</i>? He wasn't saying, was he? Just showing. Magicians were very good at dodging the issues, any issue. They would show, but not tell.<br>"You've been <i>watching</i> me," she said. Accused.<br>"Had to. For your sake as well as mine."<br>Her theatrical ear listened for the trace of a brogue, and the sword in her heart (stupid but inescapable cliche) twisted. Trust was in terminal condition and growing weaker every second. Hope was declared dead. Love was in a coma and would probably linger there for life, such as it was.<br>Still, "your sake" implied something.<br>"Max--!" She shoved her fingers into her hair.<br>He put a shushing finger to his lips, his (maybe green) eyes warning silence.<br>She glanced quickly around the room. Was it bugged?<br>Max, reading her concern, shook his head. "No one's listening to us but us, and that's two too many."<br>He moved further into the room, in a smooth big-cat glide meant to soothe. Max had the seamless, gravity-defying, sight-deceiving motion of a master mime. He stopped four feet away, behind the sofa.<br>"He's new."<br>Who? Temple was still moving in four-four time in a sixteenth-note world. She followed Max's feline-green glance to the sofa seat.<br>Oh. Louie.<br>"A stray cat I found at the Convention Center."<br>Max extended a cautious arm, the dark hairs on it gleaming as satin as Louie's well-licked coat. His fingers stroked Louie's head.<br>The cat growled, deep and long.<br>Max didn't jerk his hand away, as most people would. "He likes it here."<br>"Why shouldn't he? He gets food and affection, and comes and goes as he pleases."<br>An awkward silence prevailed, as certain personal parallels were drawn by both parties.<br>Max stepped cautiously around the sofa, nodding at Temple. "That's something new."<br>"My gi?" Goodness, she sounded casual, Temple thought. She lifted a tail of the flour-sack-pale sash. "I'm learning self-defense." Studying the yet-alien garb, she added, "Matt's my teacher."<br>How easily Max had moved from direct route to circuitous, just like a cat mincing around a foreign object. Here she was answering his very first question, whether she wanted to or not. <i>Who's the blond</i>? "Matt Devine. New neighbor."<br>"Self-defense is an admirable art." Max was noncommittal. He smiled then, that Max smile that could charm china birds off jade-bejeweled trees. "But I don't think that outfit does you justice."<br>Temple's shoulders dropped as her eyes winced shut. "In other words, I look like Dopey the dwarf."<br>In that unguarded instant, Max took his opening. Temple heard nothing, no movement. Yet she felt his hands under her elbows, then he was lifting her up, as before, until her face was level with his. Temple forced herself not to wince again.<br>He lifted her higher this time, so she was looking down on him, as if they were in bed. She stared into his hypnotically green eyes--warm, amused, probing--and their traitorous color stopped her cold again.<br>"You look adorable," he said. "You always underestimate yourself, Temple." His light tone changed. "Don't underestimate me."<br>The betraying, inevitable tears hung like isinglass curtains before her vision, frozen from falling.<br>"Max...<i>why</i>?"<br>"I can't say."<br>"Then why do you expect <i>me</i> to spill my guts?"<br>He lowered her to the floor so swiftly she felt she'd been on a carnival ride. "I have a lot of unreasonable expectations." He looked around. Temple was shocked to see that his hair had grown so long it was gathered into a pony tail. "Like expecting things to stay the same. But they don't, do they?"<br>"Some things do." Like <i>her</i> hairstyle. "Look, why don't we start over, sit down and talk?"<br>"Aren't you expected somewhere?" He eyed the gi.<br>"This." She tightened the sash as if wringing her hands instead of cotton ties. "I'll run down and say that something came up."<br>Max grinned. "Considering my method of arrival, that's not only apt, but precisely truthful."<br>"You climbed up the outside? Like Louie? Why?"<br>"The cat climbs up the outside, too?" Max glanced at the animal, not necessarily pleased to note a similarity. "I imagine we slink around for the same reasons."<br>"Hunting?" Temple asked.<br>"Or hiding." Max reached for the sunglasses again. "But don't call off your lesson. I'll come down and watch."<br>"Max, no! I'd feel...dumb. And if you are hiding--"<br>"Not too seriously at the moment, or I wouldn't be here."<br>Temple shook her head. "At least explain the Easter-egg shirt."<br>"Authentic fifties-vintage Goodwill."<br>"I know <i>what</i> it is, I want to know why you're wearing it."<br>"Why? Can't you tell? Naked isn't the best disguise, Temple. In Las Vegas, loud is."<br>She couldn't help laughing, which was better than crying. Trying to convince Max not to go where he was not wanted was always hopeless. She shrugged, picked up her keys and her sunglasses and left the apartment.<br>Max followed, on silent cat feet.<br>Her last glimpse of Midnight Louie showed that he remained sprawled like a sultan on her sofa, but his eyes were narrowed, both possessive...and suspicious.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1996 by Carole Nelson Douglas</p><h2>Angry Waters (Walter Morey Adventure Library)</h2><p>Paroled to a dairy farm, a 15-year-old slowly develops an interest in the farm and its animals and through this exposure acquires the strength to resist the influence of old friends.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Classics London Belongs To Me (Penguin Modern Classics)</h2><p>Also known as Dulcimer Street, Norman Collins&#39;s London Belongs to Me is a Dickensian romp through working-class London on the eve of the Second World War.

Increasingly strict stormwater regulations and the appeal of LEED-related projects have also boosted the popularity and desirability of green roofs. Those who want to build green roofs, however, have few resources to guide them. Until now, no book has taken a comprehensive look at how to effectively adapt green-roof technology to the variable and extreme North American climate, and how to design projects that will function and endure as successfully as those in Germany, Switzerland, and other European countries.<br><br> This book fills the gap by providing an overview of practices and techniques that have been effective in North America. The authors offer options regarding structure, function, horticulture, and logistics, as well as surveys of actual projects and analyses of why they have or haven&#x2019;t succeeded. Approachable and reader-friendly, the manual clearly explains how these complex systems function and how to plan and carry out projects successfully from concept through construction and maintenance. Ideally suited to professionals (including architects, landscape architects, engineers, and designers) and their clients, it brings together key lessons from leaders in the field. Numerous photographs highlight the range of design possibilities and show green roofs both during construction and at various stages of maturity.<br><br> At last, those seeking basic information about how to design and build green roofs have a concise, authoritative guide to this exciting new technology.</p><p><p>Writer and editor Linda McIntyre specializes in ecology, urbanism, and design.

Aircraft and ships were painted with lozenge and zigzag patterns to make them more difficult to target. Artists were involved in creating these patterns, and were influenced in turn by the extraordinary painted vessels, said to be like floating cubist paintings. In 1919 the Chelsea Arts Club in London, inspired by wartime camouflage patterns, staged the Dazzle Ball, the first known example of camouflage influencing popular culture. Since then, artists from Pablo Picasso to Andy Warhol to Bridget Riley have explored the themes and extremes of camouflage and optical illusion, while camouflage patterns in clothes and accessories have filtered from the street to high fashion and back again.<br><br> Uniforms made from camouflage-printed textiles were first developed before World War II, and teams of artists, designers, and scientists worked together to create ever more sophisticated modes of camouflage and disguise. Today's high-tech research on textiles that are resistant to infrared and thermal detection shows a new direction in the future of camouflage. 300 illustrations, 250 in color</p><p><p><strong>Tim Newark</strong> was the editor for many years of&nbsp;<em>Military Illustrated</em>, the popular British military history magazine. He is the author of numerous books, including <em>Camouflage</em>, <em>Highlander</em>, <em>The Mafia of War</em>, and has written for the <em>Financial Times</em> and the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>. He lives in London, England.</p><p><b>Jonathan Miller</b> is renowned worldwide for his contributions to theater, opera, and television.</p>Miller, the medical doctor and stage director, introduces this volume with an essay on camouflage in nature. Newark, editor of the magazine <i>Military Illustrated,</i> writes the history of camouflage in its military context starting in the 19th century and ending with the present war in Iraq. A final chapter touches on camouflage in popular culture, fine art and fashion. The development of long-range weapons taught armies the advantages of blending in rather than standing out on the battlefield. Air reconnaissance in WWI introduced the need for the disruptive pattern techniques still used by armies worldwide. Inspiration for patterns came from both nature and modern art, and scientists and artists at different times took the lead in developing techniques and materials. Cubist-inspired "Dazzle" designs covered warships, and factories disappeared under acres of netting. Newark acknowledges that camouflage has always been more effective on equipment than on men, but soldiers identify intensely with their national patterns&#x2014;frog skin, oak leaf, chocolate chip, etc. Current experiments involve iridescence and fiber optics. Newark's text is informative, but the story is told best by the 248 color and 32 black-and-white illustrations drawn from photographic archives, military training manuals, street culture and fashion layouts. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She calls this system carnism. Carnism is the belief system, or ideology, that allows us to selectively choose which animals become our meat, and it is sustained by complex psychological and social mechanisms. Like other "isms" (racism, ageism, etc.), carnism is most harmful when it is unrecognized and unacknowledged. <i>Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows</i> names and explains this phenomenon and offers it up for examination. Unlike the many books that explain why we shouldn't eat meat, Joy's book explains why we do eat meat and thus how we can make more informed choices as citizens and consumers.</p><p>Melanie Joy, Ph.D. is a social psychologist, professor, and author. She teaches psychology and sociology at the University of Massachusetts, Boston and is the leading researcher on carnism, the ideology of meat production and consumption. She is the author of <i>Strategic Action for Animals: A Handbook on Strategic Movement Building, Organizing, and Activism for Animal Liberation</i>. Dr. Joy can be found online at www.melaniejoy.org."Through the use of narrative, often bordering on biography, the arguments being put forth by Joy are very well exemplified. The images conjured are ever so vivid that it would be difficult to stop once one starts reading it. The reader is immediately and often unknowingly drawn on. The volume is extremely readable, theory and jargon free as it is. However, that is not to say that the analysis is nonscientific or arbitrary. Rather, the arguments are firmly anchored to sound psychological theorization. People from all walks of life, across age and educational backgrounds would find this book immensely interesting. People advocating vegetarianism, professors and students of psychology, scholars from other areas of social science, and even public administrators in food departments would gain considerably from this extremely well written book." Rita Agrawal, PhD, co-author, <i>Applied Social Psychology: A Global Perspective</i> (<i>Reviews</i>)<br><br>"One of the most thoughtprovoking books in decades. The realization that we've been conditioned throughout our entire lives to think and act a certain way toward animals, and that we've been so disconnected from ourselves and our fellow beings, gives us a chance to make our choices freely." Heather Mills (<i>Reviews</i>)<br><br>"Institutionalized, socially sanctioned violence on an unprecedented scale causes the needless suffering of billions of animals every year. In her groundbreaking book, Melanie Joy shakes up the completely arbitrary thinking that enables people to, at the same time, treat some animals as friends and look the other way while others are ruthlessly exploited as commodities." Gene Baur, president and cofounder of Farm Sanctuary and author of <i>Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds about Animals and Food</i> (<i>Reviews</i>)<br><br>"<i>Why We Love Dogs</i>... is an altogether remarkable book that could transform the way society feels about eating animals. You cannot read this book without learning something new and without pondering your relation to the animal world. This is a profound and deeply satisfying book that is destined to become a classic."

In today&#x2019;s volatile climate of religious conflict, prejudice, and distrust, how do we affirm the principle that the American promise is deeply intertwined with how each of us engages with people of different faiths and beliefs? Eboo Patel, former faith adviser to Barack Obama and named one of America&#x2019;s best leaders by <i>U.S. News &amp; World Report</i>, provides answers to this timely and consequential question.</p><p>In this inspiring and thought-provoking book, Patel draws on his personal experience as a Muslim in America to examine broader questions about the importance of religious diversity in the cultural, political, and economic life of the nation. He explores how religious language has given the United States some of its most enduring symbols and inspired many of its most vital civic institutions&#x2015;and demonstrates how the genius of the American experiment lies in its empowerment of people of all creeds, ethnicities, and convictions.</p><p>Will America&#x2019;s identity as a Judeo-Christian nation shift as citizens of different backgrounds grow in numbers and influence? In what ways will minority religious communities themselves change as they take root in American soil? In addressing these and other questions, Patel shows how America&#x2019;s promise is the guarantee of equal rights and dignity for all, and how that promise is the foundation of America&#x2019;s unrivaled strength as a nation. The book also includes incisive commentaries by John Inazu, Robert Jones, and Laurie Patton on American civil religion, faith and law, and the increasing number of nonreligious Americans.</p></p><p>Eboo Patel is founder and president of Interfaith Youth Core, a nonprofit organization that promotes interfaith leadership on college campuses. He is the author of Interfaith Leadership: A Primer; Sacred Ground: Pluralism, Prejudice, and the Promise of America; and Acts of Faith: The Story of an American Muslim, the Struggle for the Soul of a Generation. He lives in Chicago."Building on his prowess as an interfaith pioneer in American colleges, Patel offers a vision of pluralism that aims to guard against religious preference and particularism, advances everyday ethics, and invites Americans of many religious persuasions into civic participation. . . . Readers will be rewarded with Patel&#x2019;s rich perspective on religious diversity in America as he champions the strength of its civic identity and the possibility of religious pluralism in the years to come."

Patel sees the nativism, racism, and religious bigotry now trampling across American society, but he refuses to take his eye off the promises American citizens have made to themselves. He makes a gloriously unapologetic case for such old-fashioned American values as empathetic citizenship and religious pluralism.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Stephen Prothero, author of <i>God Is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Eboo Patel is a visionary figure in America&#x2019;s struggle with pluralism, religious and otherwise, and has been a tireless force for meaningful change on college campuses.

Thompson also wrote two screenplays (for the Stanley Kubrick films &#x201c;The Killing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Paths of Glory&#x201d;). An outstanding crime writer, the world of his fiction is rife with violence and corruption. In examining the underbelly of human experience and American society in particular, Thompson&#x2019;s work at its best is both philosophical and experimental.

Rather, he recounts his career, although only after glowingly recalling his rural Michigan childhood and poor adolescence in contrastingly tony Wilmette, Illinois--then as now among Chicago's wealthiest suburbs. A drama scholarship to Northwestern University set him on the road to success and a string of distinguished films rivaled by few other actors of his generation. The stories of making those movies are the meat here, with seasoning coming from Heston's parallel stage accomplishments, his activism with the Screen Actors' Guild (he succeeded Ronald Reagan as SAG president), words of wisdom on the crafts of acting and filmmaking, tart asides on current cultural foibles (like Reagan, he's a former Democrat turned staunch Republican), and loving references to wife and children. But there's no gossip, which movie lovers who especially admire the grand-style filmmaking of Heston's 1950s^-1960s heyday won't miss a bit, so enthralled they'll be with the production anecdotes about <i>The Ten Commandments</i>, <i>Ben-Hur</i>, and <i>El Cid</i>, among others. <i>Ray Olson</i>Heston's memoir traces an amazingly prolific and durable career from his starring roles in historical epics of the 1950s and 1960s (The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur) through disaster films of the 1970s (Earthquake) and into recent years spent largely as a stage actor and in TV character roles. As a published author (Bejing Diary, LJ 10/1/90, and the best-selling The Actor's Life, LJ 12/1/78), Heston no doubt actually wrote this volume and can be presumed to be a reliable chronicler. Throughout he is unusually generous to colleagues, totally devoted to his family, and surprisingly restrained in offering his well-publicized conservative political views.

Now he proves himself a meteoric and masterful new talent.<br>This workmanlike suspense thriller by the author of Laguna Heat takes its name from the populous Vietnamese community in California's Orange County, an intriguing although largely unexplored backdrop for the action. Chuck Frye, a surf bum who has recently failed at journalism, business and marriage, lives in the shadow of his war-hero brother Bennett, and their father, a wealthy real-estate tycoon. Bennett's Vietnamese wife is a singer whose protest music has made her a heroine among anticommunists and Asian expatriates. When she is kidnapped during a performance, Chuck joins the search for her, hoping to end his estrangement from the Frye clan. But the more he learns about the crime's motivepolitics, gang warfare or revenge are all possibilitiesthe more intently his family tries to shut him out of the investigation. Meanwhile, the body count continues to mount. Parker's methodical story moves briskly but permits few surprises, and his novel could do without a silly subplot about Chuck's personal redemption, which apparently lies not only in finding his sister-in-law but also in regaining the courage to ride a big wave after a surfing accident. 125,000 first printing; $125,000 ad/promo. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Desperate Valour: Triumph at Anzio</h2><p><b>A riveting and comprehensive account of the Battle of Anzio and the Alamo-like stand of American and British troops that turned certain defeat into victory</b><br>The four-month-long 1944 battle on Italy's coast, south of Rome, was one of World War II's longest and bloodiest battles.

Women also play a prominent part in events, from court politics and artistic patronage to occasionally ruling. 260 illustrations, 140 in color.</p><p><b>Francis Robinson</b> is Professor of the History of South Asia at the University of London. He has also been Visiting Professor at the University of Washington, as well as President of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland. He is the author of numerous books on the Islamic world.This illustrated volume is a fascinating, thorough history covering dozens of Middle Eastern and Indian leaders from the 13th century on, each struggling with the problems of maintaining strong central power among a wide-spread, pre-industrial society. When not conquering and pillaging, the profiled rulers-who exhibit tremendous passion and curiosity-experimented with the use of paper currency, built monuments that still stand today and fostered advancements in calligraphy, poetry, architecture, painting, mathematics and astronomy. Each emperor's tale is unique, but among this span of rulers several constants remain: Islam and the range of ideas it offers are constantly subordinated by the demands of power, substance abuse is widespread, and women are given a surprising role in architecture, business and political ventures. Just as commonplace are illicit affairs, strained alliances, ascendancy struggles and morbid deaths (Il Khan leader Teguder is killed "by having his back broken, a form of execution which, like being kicked to death in a carpet, avoided the spilling of noble blood"). These stories, accompanied by full-color illustrations, capture beautifully the glory, excess and tragedy at the heart of these illustrious Islamic dynasties. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Stephen White&#x2019;s Alan Gregory novels are beloved by both fans and critics&#x2014;the most recent, <i>Dead Time</i>, was a USA Today and Book-Sense bestseller. In <i>The Siege</i>, Gregory&#x2019;s longtime friend Sam Purdy takes center stage in a story that feels ripped from tomorrow&#x2019;s headlines. From the first page on, readers need to be buckled in for a nonstop ride full of terror and pathos. As a lovely weekend approaches on the Yale campus it appears that a number of students&#x2014;including the sons of both the Secretary of the Army and newest Supreme Court justice&#x2014;may have gone missing. Kidnapping? Terrorism? The authorities aren&#x2019;t sure. But the high-profile disappearances draw the attention of the CIA and the FBI&#x2019;s vaunted Hostage Rescue Team. Attention quickly focuses on the fortress-like tomb of one of Yale&#x2019;s secret societies. Suspended Boulder police detective Sam Purdy soon finds himself in New Haven, where he is quickly snared by an unlikely pair of Feds: FBI agent Christopher Poe and CIA analyst Deirdre Drake. Sam, Poe, and Dee join together, desperately trying to solve the riddle of what is going on inside the windowless stone tomb on the edge of campus. The clock is pounding in their ears. The unknown enemy is playing by no known rules . . . is making no demands . . . is refusing to communicate with the hostage negotiator . . . is somehow anticipating every FBI move . . . is completely unconcerned about getting away . . . And . . . is sending students, one by one, out of the building&#x2019;s front door to die.</p><p>Stephen White is a clinical psychologist and the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of sixteen previous suspense novels, including <i>Dead Time</i> and <i>Dry Ice</i>.<b><p>April 19, Saturday Midday </p> <p>New Haven </p> </b> <br> <p>The building on the edge of campus could be mistaken for a mausoleum erected beyond the boundary of the cemetery across the street. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s not. </p> <p>Some assume it is a mock courtroom for the nearby law school. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s not that either. </p> <p>Although the structure&#x2019;s Ionic columns suggest the imperial, like a treasury, or evoke the divine, like a temple, the word &#x201c;tomb&#x201d; is the tag attached by the community. The building puts out no mat and welcomes no stranger&#x2014;the classic style was chosen not to invite attention, but rather to feel as familiar to passersby as the profile of the elm tree that shades the marble steps leading up from the street. The scale is deceptive. The neighboring edifices are large and imposing, with Gothic flourishes or neoclassical grandeur. In comparison, the tomb feels more stout and diminutive than it actually is. </p> <p>The building&#x2019;s unadorned back is the only face that it reveals to the college. The sides are rectangular planes of marble blocks staggered in a brick pattern from ground to roof. There are no windows. In front, paired entry doors are recessed below a shallow gable at the top of eight stairs. That portal, trimmed in stone, framed by columns, overlooks the ancient plots of a graveyard that counts among its ghosts the remains of Eli Whitney and Noah Webster. </p> <p>An iron fence, the posts smithed in the form of slithering serpents, separates the building from the public sidewalks on the adjacent streets. The architecture is symbolic. The few decorative elements are symbolic. The site is symbolic. What happens inside the building is, at least occasionally, symbolic. </p> <p>This fine spring day, though, the crowds gathering behind the hastily established police lines aren&#x2019;t gawking because of any symbolism. The curious are gathering because of the rumors of what is going down&#x2014;that some students might be locked inside the mysterious building. </p> <p>The spectators don&#x2019;t know it yet, but the reality is they are there because the building is a damn fort. </p> <p>A door opens and closes rapidly. When the young man emerges in front of the building his sudden appearance seems to have been part of an illusion. </p> <p>His eyes blink as they adjust to the light. Across the street he sees a crowd contained behind red-and-white saw horse barricades stenciled with the initials of the campus police. At the periphery, on both sides, are television cameras. Nearest to him, cops, lots of cops. Many have just raised their guns. </p> <p>The young man jerks his head, startled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t shoot! Don&#x2019;t fucking shoot!&#x201d; he says. </p> <p>He lifts his arms high before he takes two cautious steps forward. He stops a few feet in front of the row of columns. It is the spot a politician might choose to make a speech. </p> <p>His eyes close for a moment. When he opens them again, his irises&#x2014;the same shade of green as the leaves budding out on the elm tree near the curb&#x2014;are so brilliant they look backlit. </p> <p>The brilliance is generated by the terror churning in his cells.</p> <p>Two clusters of cops, one huddled group on each side of the building, begin to edge toward him in measured steps. The police are in full body armor and have raised weapons. Some carry shields. </p> <p>&#x201c;No! Don&#x2019;t come forward!&#x201d; he yells, matching their adrenaline drop for drop. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t! Don&#x2019;t! Do not come near me! I am a bomb.&#x201d; The cops slow at that caution. </p> <p>The young man is dressed in worn jeans and an untucked striped dress shirt over a T-shirt. He is barefoot. His chin and cheeks are spotted with stubble. Other than the absence of shoes, his appearance is not unlike that of many of his peers on campus. </p> <p>He lowers his arms before he lifts the front of his shirt. &#x201c;See that! It&#x2019;s a bomb. I&#x2019;m a bomb. I . . . am . . . a bomb. Stay where you are.&#x201d; </p> <p>On his abdomen, below his navel, is a rectangular object the size of a thick paperback book. It is held in place with tape that wraps around his hips. On the tape are handwritten block letters that read, &#x201c;BOMB.&#x201d; </p> <p>A few wires are visible at the top of the bulge. </p> <p>The device appears about as threatening as a burlesque prop. </p> <p>An officer barks an order. The approaching cops stop in their tracks. A few take a step or two back. </p> <p>The young man releases his shirt, covering the apparatus at his waist. All eyes are on him. He waits until there is complete silence. He opens his mouth to speak, but his throat is so dry he coughs. Finally, he manages to say, &#x201c;I&#x2014; He wants the . . . cell towers . . . turned back on.&#x201d; The young man&#x2019;s voice catches on the word &#x201c;back.&#x201d; He pauses, as though to think. &#x201c;The news cameras stay in place. He says you have five minutes.&#x201d; He lifts his wrist and looks at his watch. &#x201c;Starting right now.&#x201d; </p> <p>Near the police barricades two men in suits begin conferring with a woman wearing khaki pants and a simple top. She has a badge clipped to the front of her trousers. </p> <p>The younger of the two men is telling the woman that they know nothing about a cell tower shutdown. </p> <p>In an even voice, the woman says, &#x201c;Then how about somebody finds out?&#x201d; She takes one step forward. </p> <p>She has been preparing for this moment for hours. She is thinking, <i>Finally, let the show begin. </i> </p> <p>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; she says, addressing the hostage. &#x201c;My name is Christine Carmody. I&#x2019;m a negotiator with the New Haven Police. I know you&#x2019;re scared.&#x201d; </p> <p>She waits for his eyes to find her. To pick her khaki and pink out of the sea of blue. She is eager for this young man to make her his personal oasis. &#x201c;I just requested that an order be given to get those towers working.&#x201d; </p> <p>She is choosing her words carefully, beginning to communicate to the unseen subject that there is an active chain of command, that things will proceed in a certain way, that everything that happens going forward will take time. Mostly, she wants anyone inside the tomb to begin to understand that she is but a conduit, that she doesn&#x2019;t control the world of blue uniforms and blue steel he sees around her. &#x201c;Please . . . please tell . . . him? Is that right? . . . It&#x2019;s a him? If he has a name, I&#x2019;d love to know it, so I know what to call him . . . Five minutes? Please tell him that we can&#x2019;t do it that quickly. Not quite that fast. It&#x2019;s just not possible.&#x201d; </p> <p>She has no intention of cooperating with this first demand on the hostage taker&#x2019;s timetable. Certainly not <i>yessir, right away, sir. </i> One of the initial goals of her business&#x2014;her business is hostage negotiation&#x2014; is to make contact with the hostage taker and begin to establish rapport. Talking through this hostage, or any hostage, isn&#x2019;t what she has in mind. Her response to the first demand reflects her underlying strategy. She will use this preliminary request to begin to set the piers for the bridge that will lead to direct discussions with the still-unseen hostage taker. </p> <p>Sergeant Christine Carmody&#x2019;s African-American father died during the fall of Saigon in 1975. She grew up on Long Island with her Puerto Rican mother. Her life has not been easy; it&#x2019;s been about always being tough enough to take it and about trying to be smart enough not to have to fight about it. She&#x2019;s been talking her way out of tight spots since the day she stepped off her first school bus. </p> <p>Consonant with her desire to be invisibly obstreperous with the unseen hostage taker, at least at first, her voice is as close to level as she can make it. She makes sure that any lilt in her tone exudes respect and the promise of cooperation and conciliation. She is also trying to make certain that whoever is inside begins to understand that the current situation has real limitations. </p> <p>Carmody is cognizant of the purported bomb. For the moment, she is thinking about it the way she thinks about God. She is slightly more of a skeptic than a believer. </p> <p>She says, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get me wrong, I&#x2019;m not aware of anything that will keep us from working something out about the phones. It must be some kind of technical problem. But we&#x2019;re on that. Nothing makes me think that will turn out to be a big concern. He&#x2014;you said, &#x2018;He,&#x2019; right?&#x2014;can . . . call me. We can talk directly. He and I. That&#x2019;s probably the best way to get all this worked out. He and I can begin to solve this problem.&#x201d; </p> <p>A uniformed officer hands her a scribbled sign. She holds it up so that it is facing the young man. &#x201c;As soon as we solve the cell tower thing, this is the number that will get through directly to me. Me, personally.&#x201d; She holds her mobile phone aloft so the young man can see it. &#x201c;Like I said, it shouldn&#x2019;t be an issue. His? . . . It&#x2019;s a he? I have that right?&#x201d; </p> <p>The young man does not react to her words. He does not reply to her questions. </p> <p>&#x201c;Okay. Like I said, his request is . . . something to discuss. Absolutely. I&#x2019;m ready to talk about it, explain what&#x2019;s going on at my end, what we can do to solve this. How about a radio that will work until the cell phones are up again? We&#x2019;ll give you one of ours&#x2014;for him to use to talk to me in the meantime. We will work this out. Absolutely.&#x201d; She emphasizes &#x201c;will.&#x201d; </p> <p>The young man doesn&#x2019;t acknowledge her. He doesn&#x2019;t move. </p> <p>She waits. The frittering away of seconds doesn&#x2019;t concern her. Time is on her side. </p> <p>The young man closes his eyes. A good ten seconds pass before he opens them. </p> <p>&#x201c;Okay, first things first,&#x201d; she says. Her confidence has grown a tiny measure becaus...</p></p><h2>Run Away</h2><p><b>A perfect family is shattered when their daughter goes missing in this "brilliantly executed" <i>New York Times</i> bestselling thriller from a "master storyteller" (<i>Providence Sunday Journal</i>).</b><b><br></b><b>You've lost your daughter.</b> <br> She's addicted to drugs and to an abusive boyfriend.

His mother, determined that Matthew&#39;s life should have meaning, has become an activist for the inclusion of sexual orientation in hate crime legislation (the federal act, named for Matthew, was enacted in October 2009) and for gay rights in general. Judy Shepard&#39;s narration is consistent with her statements in the book that in various public situations she is determined not to break down--as she wants the focus of the story to be Matthew, not her. Matthew&#39;s father delivers the statement he made at the trial of one of the assailants. Both parents read in tightly controlled voices that are poignant and, by the absence of dramatization, tell a haunting story.

Despite differences in language, appearance, or culture, maps are universal touchstones in human civilization.<br> &nbsp;<br> Over the centuries, maps have served many varied purposes; far from mere guides for reaching a destination, they are unique artistic forms, aides in planning commercial routes, literary devices for illuminating a story. Accuracy&#x2014;or inaccuracy&#x2014;of maps has been the make-or-break factor in countless military battles throughout history. They have graced the walls of homes, bringing prestige and elegance to their owners. They track the mountains, oceans, and stars of our existence. Maps help us make sense of our worlds both real and imaginary&#x2014;they bring order to the seeming chaos of our surroundings.<br> &nbsp;<br> With <i>The Curious Map Book</i>, Ashley Baynton-Williams gathers an amazing, chronologically ordered variety of cartographic gems, mainly from the vast collection of the British Library. He has unearthed a wide array of the whimsical and fantastic, from maps of board games to political ones, maps of the Holy Land to maps of the human soul. In his illuminating introduction, Baynton-Williams also identifies and expounds upon key themes of map production, peculiar styles, and the commerce and collection of unique maps. This incredible volume offers a wealth of gorgeous illustrations for anyone who is cartographically curious.&nbsp;</p><p><b>Ashley Baynton-Williams</b>&nbsp;is an antiquarian map dealer and researcher based in London and the author of several books.<br>&#x201c;Baynton-Williams&#x2019;s interest lies less in maps as geographic tools than as playthings and lampoons. He&#x2019;s put together a hundred board games, allegorical maps, maps in animal forms and other &#x2018;cartographic curiosities,&#x2019; in a fascinating volume that begins with a woodcut of the world from 1493 (wholly excluding the Americas, southern Africa and the Far East), and ending with an Afghanistan map-rug that was made in 2008 for �souvenir-hunting American soldiers there.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Map-making is usually considered a serious, objective endeavour. But these whimsical creations aren&#x2019;t just fun &#x2013; they also give surprising insight into the British psyche....Despite the creativity of these maps, which range from games to political cartoons, they are as instructive as they are imaginative." (<i>BBC</i>)<br><br>"If you relish in the lost art of mapmaking, this hardcover book is perfect for whimsical browsing. With an extensive collection of peculiar maps&#x2014;from those shaped like animals to the ones used for board games&#x2014;it&#x2019;s sure to spruce up your bookshelf and provide hours of fascinating material." (<i>Red Eye Chicago</i>)<br><br>"The book is the kind of quality production one expects from the University of Chicago Press, with excellent colour reproductions, thorough cartobibliography and serviceable index.&nbsp;Bayton-Williams is a third-generation map dealer and author of several other cartographic works; his experience shows. His descriptions often reflect research into both historical context and publishing history. By virtue of Bayton-Williams&#x2019;s selections, the clarity of his descriptions, and the quality of the reproductions, this book is well suited to introduce the joys of old maps to a popular audience. And it also offers some useful material for experienced scholars, students and collectors. Beyond these virtues, I rank this work particularly high on the growing list of coffee-table map books because it shines a welcome light on cartographical curiosities.&nbsp;Mapmakers and scholars formerly embraced an &#x2018;empiricist paradigm&#x2019;: that the only legitimate objective of the cartographer was to create maps of ever greater geographical accuracy and clarity. There is today a new focus: &#x2018;scientific&#x2019; and &#x2018;curious&#x2019; maps alike stand on more equal footing, and all are subjected to more rigorous study and analysis. Baynton-Williams&#x2019;s new book is another step in this direction, and that is one more reason to commend it." (<i>Imago Mundi</i>)<br><br>"In The Curious Map Book, antiquarian map researcher Baynton-Williams has assembled a glorious collection of historical maps, mostly from the collection of the British Museum. He selects fine representatives of several genres of maps dating from the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, offering scholarly commentary on each."<br> &nbsp; (<i>The Explorer's Journal</i>)<br><br>"<i>The Curious Map Book</i> is curious indeed, and delightful reading or browsing for geographers, historians, and map aficionados alike. A&nbsp;pleasure to read and, even more so, to linger over, savoring the cartographic details that may not help us to navigate anywhere, but certainly help us to understand how we got here."

His books are made up of case histories of his patients, and explore both their neurological disorders and the strategies they adopted to cope with them. In this book, Sacks draws on the stories of his patients and his own experiences with hallucinogenics to show how hallucinations have influenced every culture&#39;s folklore and art, and why the potential for hallucination is in all of us and not confined to the mentally ill. Slightly off-mint.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2012:</strong> A familiar song on mental repeat, a shadowy movement in an empty house--many of us experience minor visual and auditory hallucinations and think nothing of it. Neurologist and professor Oliver Sacks concerns himself with those for whom such breaks with reality are acute and life altering. Dr. Sacks&#x2019; latest book--one of the most compelling in his fascinating oeuvre--centers on Charles Bonnet syndrome, a condition characterized by intricate visual hallucinations. Weaving together case studies with anecdotes from his own past and accessible medical explanations, Dr. Sacks introduces us to Sharon, whose vision is invaded by Kermit the Frog; Gertie, whose phantasmal gentleman caller visits each evening, bearing gifts; and a host of other patients whose experiences elicit both sympathy and self-reflection. (The good doctor also shares his own experiments with hallucinogenic drugs, to comic and insightful effect.) <em>Hallucinations</em> is Oliver Sacks at his best: as learned, introspective, and approachable as we could possibly imagine. --<em>Mia Lipman</em><br><br> <p><b>The Neurological and the Divine: An Interview with Oliver Sacks</b></p> <p>The following is an excerpt from a Q&amp;A with Dr. Sacks published on Omnivoracious, the Amazon Books blog. Click here to read the full interview.</p> <p><i>Mia Lipman: In</i> Hallucinations<i>, you mention that your childhood migraines are one of the reasons you became a neurologist. How did they help shape your path?</i></p> <p>Dr. Sacks: My experiences go back to my first memories of when I was three or four, suddenly seeing a brilliant zigzag which seemed to be vibrating, then enlarged and covered everything to one side. This has happened innumerable times since, but that first time was very terrifying...I know I was in the garden, and part of the garden wall seemed to disappear, and I asked my mother about it. She too had classical migraines, so she explained what it was about and said that it was benign and it would only last a few minutes, and I'd be none the worse. So though I'm not in love with the attacks, it's nice to know that one can live with this quite well.</p> <p><i>So that early experience made you curious about why this was happening to you?</i></p> <p>Indeed, and there were other experiences. Sometimes it was just color, perhaps in one half of the visual field, or things would be frozen and I couldn't see any movement. So I think this gave me a very early feeling that it's only the privilege of a normal brain which allows us to see the way we do&#x2014;and that what seems to be a simple vision in fact must have dozens of different components, and any one of these can go down. So it was a learning experience for me as well. </p> <p><i>Speaking of learning experiences, you talk in the book about a period in your 30s when you did a lot of hallucinogenic drugs&#x2014;</i></p> <p>Ah, I thought that would come up. [Laughing.] </p> <p><i>Of course, it's the best part! I especially liked your description of the results as "a mix of the neurological and the divine." What did this self-experimentation teach you about your field, as well as personally?</i></p> <p>I can't conceal that my motives were sort of mixed, but these were learning experiences as well as recreational ones, and occasionally terrifying ones. The gain, I think, [is that] it's a way of revealing various capacities and incapacities in the brain, including, perhaps, mystical ones...I quote William James, who, after taking nitrous oxide, said that it showed him there were many forms of consciousness other than rational consciousness, and that these seem to be uncovered one by one. And that's quite an experience. I do not recommend it to anybody, and I hope my writing about these things is not seen as a recommendation. I think I'm very lucky to have survived them, which several of my friends and contemporaries didn't.</p> <p><b>&gt;</b> Continue reading "The Neurological and the Divine: An Interview with Oliver Sacks"</p>Oliver Sacks is a practicing physician and the author of 10 books, including &#34;The Mind&#39;s Eye,&#34; &#34;Musicophilia, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&#34; and &#34;Awakenings&#34; (which inspired the Oscar-nominated film).

These forces include electricity, magnetism and the deeper reaches of touch, smell, taste and sound. Peter Redgrove presents evidence to suggest that not only individuals but the world as a whole stands to benefit from simple awareness. Presiding over this transition from unconscious to conscious experience is the symbolic presence of the Black Goddess, who may be traced in many guises from ancient to modern times - from tantric oracles and gnostic cults to Coleridge&#39;s poetry and Surrealist painting. The book blends the poetry of &#34;The White Goddess&#34; with the wide-ranging applications of &#34;Supernature&#34; to express this general need for more awareness.

The focus here is on 11-year-old Mike Kel ley, who is placed with a German immi grant farmer more interested in acquir ing cheap labor than a new family member. When Mike overhears Frie drich and his kind-hearted wife discuss ing their fear of retribution over a man's death, he suspects foul play. The imagi native youngster's suspicions are ag gravated when his best friend Reuben, an educated farmhand, disappears after a loud altercation with the overseer. The puzzle is believably pieced togeth er as the motivations of father and son are revealed at story's end. Unfortu nately, this revelation does little to ex tend the dimension of these two flat characters who approach ethnic stereo types. The industry and discipline re quired by agrarians of the period, along with their isolation (an element which contributes to the book's suspenseful, at times melodramatic, tone), is ade quately conveyed. On the other hand, information about slavery and immigra tion is presented in a contrived manner. Flaws outweigh attributes. Events re ferred to which occured in the first in stallment are unclear, plot threads are unresolved, and the dialogue is weak. In the final analysis, this is more of a suspense novel with a historical setting than a solid historical novel with a sus penseful storyline.Julie Corsaro, Univ. of Chicago Laboratory Schools<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Acts (IVP New Testament Commentary Series)</h2><p>If ever there was a hostile environment for the gospel, it was the strife-torn, ethnically diverse backwater of the Roman Empire known as Palestine following the ascension of Jesus. But the gospel thrived--beginning from Jerusalem and spreading throughout Judea, Samaria and the rest of the known world. In Acts, the sequel to his Gospel, Luke tells how the Holy Spirit transformed a ragtag band of believers into a unified, world-engaging church. And as William Larkin explores this narrative of the early church, he offers inspiration and insight for readers who wonder how the gospel may be advanced in the increasingly divided and skeptical culture of the late twentieth century. In this clear, incisive commentary, readers will find an introduction with background material concerning authorship, date and purpose, as well as a summary of important theological themes. A passage-by-passage exposition follows that focuses on understanding what significance Acts had for its original readers in order to see its relevance for the church today. Students, pastors, Bible teachers and everyone who wants to understand the message of Matthew for the church will benefit from this excellent resource.</p><p></p><h2>Trick Baby</h2><p>Iceberg Slim tells the story of a blue eyed, light haired, white skinned Negro called &#34;White Folks&#34; He was the most incredible con man the ghetto ever spawned!</p><p><b>Iceberg Slim</b> (1918-1992), a.k.a.

With a family to feed, he folded his life into the pages of <i>Pimp</i>, which emerged as a definitive chronicle of street life.

As described in spare, poetic passages, events concern the manager of the local supermarket, Walter Higgins. A caring husband and father, proud of his family and the status he has achieved after a deprived childhood in a New Jersey slum, Higgins happily anticipates joining the country club. When the committee blackballs him, the snub is a terrible blow. Higgins's wife and their children give him loving support but he becomes obsessed by thoughts of revenge against those who play a game with secret rules against those who "don't count." At this critical time, an emergency takes Higgins to his old neighborhood and the novel to a dramatically different turn. Simenon's pitiless observations of snobbish cruelty and his compassion for outcasts provoke thoughts of the pecking order that exists in communities everywhere. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Organizing for Social Change: A Manual for Activists in the 1990s</h2><p>Here is a comprehensive manual for grassroots organizers working for social, political, environmental, and economic change at the local, state, and national level.

Now a psychiatrist and assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at UCLA, she works with police departments by using her psychic abilities to help locate missing persons and identify suspects. In her clinical practice, she claims, her clairvoyant gifts enable her to get information about patients' health, relationships, careers and childhoods, and to discern stumbling blocks that are not readily apparent. A premonition warned her of one patient's upcoming suicide attempt. With another patient afflicted with debilitating rheumatoid arthritis, Orloff says, she successfully used hands-on healing, or therapeutic touch. She encourages analysands to use prayer, meditation, ritual and dream journals to promote emotional healing. She movingly describes the dreams and visions that helped her draw closer to her mother, who succumbed to cancer in 1993.

I expect there&#39;ll be what I believe is called an &#34;intervention&#34; soon. I keep picturing it. All my friends bearing down on me and me denying everything until my pockets are emptied. Oh the shame&#39; In his early thirties, Stephen Fry - writer, comedian, star of stage and screen - had, as they say, &#39;made it&#39;. Much loved in A Bit of Fry and Laurie, Blackadder and Jeeves and Wooster, author of a critically acclaimed and bestselling first novel, The Liar, with a glamorous and glittering cast of friends, he had more work than was perhaps good for him. What could possibly go wrong? Then, as the 80s drew to a close, he discovered a most enjoyable way to burn the candle at both ends, and took to excess like a duck to breadcrumbs. Writing and recording by day, and haunting a never ending series of celebrity parties, drinking dens, and poker games by night, in a ludicrous and impressive act of bravado, he fooled all those except the very closest to him, some of whom were most enjoyably engaged in the same dance. He was - to all intents and purposes - a high functioning addict. Blazing brightly and partying wildly as the 80s turned to the 90s, AIDS became an epidemic and politics turned really nasty, he was so busy, so distracted by the high life, that he could hardly see the inevitable, headlong tumble that must surely follow . . . Containing raw, electric extracts from his diaries of the time, More Fool Me is a brilliant, eloquent account by a man driven to create and to entertain - revealing a side to him he has long kept hidden. Stephen Fry is an award-winning comedian, actor, presenter and director. He rose to fame alongside Hugh Laurie in A Bit of Fry and Laurie (which he co-wrote with Laurie) and Jeeves and Wooster, and was unforgettable as Captain Melchett in Blackadder. He also presented Stephen Fry: The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive, his groundbreaking documentary on bipolar disorder, to huge critical acclaim.

The earth&#x2019;s vegetation went through equally dramatic changes, from tropical jungles in Montana and forests at the poles, to grasslands and savannas across the entire world.

He had a quiet life by many standards, but in one respect it was exemplary, even legendary; he made an early reputation in little magazines, decided to stop writing verse when still only 20, kept his silence for 20 years, then began again; and his first book of verse, published when he was 45, was his masterpiece La Jeune Parque.&#39;A poem should not mean, but be,&#39; said Archibald MacLeish. La Jeune Parque (&#39;the goddess of Fate as a young woman&#39;) certainly exists: she&#39;s beautiful and makes great gestures. And as for what she means, there&#39;s a substantial amount of argument about that, so La Jeune Parque is a poem by either definition. It&#39;s a classic, by general agreement, written to the full 17th-century recipe for alexandrine couplets, and it&#39;s modern, with every word pulling its weight in more than one direction.Alistair Elliot&#39;s translation with notes is aimed at making this rewarding but difficult long poem accessible enough for bafflement to turn into admiration. He attempts to clarify its small puzzles and also trace the overall narrative line of Paul Valery&#39;s poem: it does have a story (what should a young woman do?) and does struggle towards a resolution. He also provides an introduction which deals with the interesting circumstances of the poem&#39;s four-year composition (1913-17), which resulted in Valery&#39;s instantly becoming a famous poet at the age of 45, after having written no poetry for 20 years.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Lifecycle of Software Objects</h2><p>What's the best way to create artificial intelligence? In 1950, Alan Turing wrote, 'Many people think that a very abstract activity, like the playing of chess, would be best. It can also be maintained that it is best to provide the machine with the best sense organs that money can buy, and then teach it to understand and speak English. This process could follow the normal teaching of a child. Things would be pointed out and named, etc. Again I do not know what the right answer is, but I think both approaches should be tried.'<br><br>The first approach has been tried many times in both science fiction and reality. In this new novella, at over 30,000 words, his longest work to date, Ted Chiang offers a detailed imagining of how the second approach might work within the contemporary landscape of startup companies, massively-multiplayer online gaming, and open-source software. It's a story of two people and the artificial intelligences they helped create, following them for more than a decade as they deal with the upgrades and obsolescence that are inevitable in the world of software. At the same time, it's an examination of the difference between processing power and intelligence, and of what it means to have a real relationship with an artificial entity.</p><p>Is science fiction a literature of ideas, or of characters? Works that focus on the former often neglect the latter, and vice versa. It's very difficult to examine complex abstractions and simultaneously articulate the mechanisms of fiction: most writers who attempt this balancing act end up throttling back on the ideas, or fail sideways into technical writing. So Chiang's novella--the second piece he's ever published that's long enough to stand on its own, following the 2007 Hugo- and Nebula-winning The Merchant and the Alchemist's Gate--is a welcome surprise: a triumphant combination of the rigorous extrapolation of artificial intelligence and artificial life, two of the high concepts of contemporary SF, with an exploration of its consequences for the ordinary people whose lives it derails. Ana Alvarado is a former zookeeper turned software tester. When Blue Gamma offers her a job as animal trainer for their digients--digital entities, spawned by genetic algorithms to provide pets for players in the future virtual reality of Data Earth--she discovers an unexpected affinity for her charges. So does Derek Brooks, an animator who designs digient body parts. The market for digients develops and expands, cools and declines after the pattern of the software industry. Meanwhile Ana, Derek, and their friends become increasingly attached to their cute and talkative charges, who are neither pets nor children but something wholly new. But as Blue Gamma goes bust and Data Earth itself fades into obsolescence, Ana and the remaining digient keepers face a series of increasingly unpleasant dilemmas, their worries sharpened by their charges' growing awareness of the world beyond their pocket universe, and the steady unwinding of their own lives and relationships into middle-aged regrets for lost opportunities. Keeping to the constraints of a novella while working on a scale of years is a harsh challenge. Chiang's prose is sparse and austere throughout, relying on hints and nudges to provide context. At times, the narrative teeters on the edge of arid didacticism; there are enough ideas to fill a lesser author's trilogy, but much of the background is present only by implication, forcing the reader to work to fill in the blanks. (Indeed, this story may be impenetrable to readers who aren't at least passingly familiar with computers, the Internet, and virtual worlds such as Second Life.) Fortunately, sheer conceptual density keeps the story solidly real. The life cycle of the software objects in question is viewed through the prism of the human protagonists' own life cycle, and this skeleton is the armature on which hangs that very rare thing: a science fictional novel of ideas that delivers a real human impact.

All rights reserved.In this age of doorstop novels, how nice to learn that this 144-page novella is Chiang&#x2019;s longest story ever. Despite that brevity, the action spans several years, from the day zookeeper trying to turn software tester Ana Alvarado hears about the job offer to train start-up developer Blue Gamma&#x2019;s linguistically capable, continuously educable digients (or virtual pets) to the moment she decides to prepare Jax, the digient she adopts, to live on his own. By the time of that final decision, Blue Gamma is long gone, the platform for its digients has become isolated, and a small band of Ana&#x2019;s fellow BG digient owners is desperate for the money to build a port to the current dominant platform, desperate enough to consider licensing the digients to a sex-toy developer. To tell this temporally long story, intertwining it with the story of fellow BG ex-employee and digient owner Derek&#x2019;s repressed romantic longing for Ana, Chiang pares exposition and ethical reflection to the bone, without reducing an affecting story to an arid fable. Some writers just can&#x2019;t go on and on.

Nonetheless, the major naval developments during their reigns--developments that effectively turned the Royal Navy into a permanent, professional fighting force--have traditionally been attributed to Samuel Pepys.<p><i>Kings of the Sea</i> presents a provocative new theory: that the creation of the proper "Royal Navy" was, in fact, due principally to the Stuart brothers.

In earlier times, he had foolishly tried retreats within comm reach of his workplace, and that was not at all helpful. There would always be some crisis, something for which his help would be required. As his salary and sense increased, he took his retreats farther and farther away, until at last he found himself going off-�planet to distant temples where the rule of silence and solitude could not be broken by convenient technologies.<br><br>This season, he had chosen Gharvi, a place with small wooden buildings scattered around a huge temple of stone, all set within the rain shadow of a mountain range. An endless ocean, both vista and inspiration, ran parallel to the mountains, and a beach between the two offered long walks to nowhere on either side. A place of two deserts, some said, for sea and land were bleak together&#x2014;�one boundless, one narrow, and both thirsty.<br><br>There was a place at home very like it, and that had probably influenced his choice, but the sky was unique. The atmosphere was the cloudy bluish lavender of a recently bioformed planet, and the sun was scorching bright. It was so unlike the cool, strong blues and gentle sunlight of his home world that for the first few days he kept his head down and his door closed till nightfall.<br><br>On the twelfth day, he took his handheld, replete with work well completed, and put it in the box outside his hermitage door. He cooked and ate his evening lentils, slept soundly through the night, and rose to prepare his morning porridge. There was a little water left over from the day before (he was ever frugal), but to have enough for washing he had to fetch the new day&#x2019;s supply from the box. The young acolytes of the temple always put sufficient water and food into each hermit&#x2019;s box before dawn. It was enough to stay clean, to fill the solar pot with porridge or pottage, and to sip and slake the constant thirst that was the natural consequence of dry air and silence. The acolytes would also take away his handheld and safely transmit its contents to his workplace.<br><br>But his handheld was still there.<br><br>He paused, confused by this disconnect in the seamless order of the temple&#x2019;s routine. He stared at the untouched box. He looked up and frowned in puzzlement at the squat shape of the temple, vaguely visible through a haze of heat, blown sand, and sea spray.<br><br>Then he shrugged and went on with his day, a little dustier, a little thirstier, but convinced that an explanation would eventually be made manifest.<br><br>The following morning, well before dawn, the sound of the box lid closing woke him from a sleep made restless by dreams of dryness. He waited a bit, then went to bring in the supplies and drink deeply of the water. His handheld was gone, and a double ration of food sat in its place. He did not even peer into the darkness to catch sight of the tardy acolyte. Order had been restored.<br><br>&#x201c;Dllenahkh, with your level of sensitivity and strength, you must go on retreat regularly.&#x201d; So he had been told long ago by the guestmaster of his monastery. &#x201c;You are constantly looking to set things to rights, even within yourself. A retreat will teach you again and again that you are neither indispensable nor self-sufficient.&#x201d;<br><br>Put bluntly, learn to stop meddling. Commitment is important, detachment equally so. He congratulated himself on his developing ability to keep curiosity in check and spent the next few days in undisturbed meditation and reflection.<br><br>One day, after a long morning meditation, he felt thirsty and decided to get more water from his supply box. He stepped out with his glass drinking bowl in hand and set it on the edge of the box while he tilted the half lid and reached inside. His hands were steady as he poured water smoothly from the heavy, narrow-necked jug. Moving slowly, he straightened and took a moment of blissful idleness, the jug left uncovered near his feet, to squint at the sun glare on the desert beach and the desert ocean and to feel the coolness of the water creeping into his palms as he held the bowl and waited to drink. It was a child&#x2019;s game, to hold a bowl of water and mark the increase of thirst with masochistic pleasure, but he did it sometimes.<br><br>He brought the bowl to his mouth and had a perfect instant of pale blue ocean, bright blue glass, and clear water in his vision before he blinked, sipped, and swallowed.<br><br>Many times afterward, when he tried to recall, his mind would stop at that vivid memory&#x2014;�the neatly nested colors, the soothing coolness of the glass&#x2014;�and not wish to go any further. It was not long after that, not very long at all, that the day became horribly disordered.<br><br>A man walked out of the ocean, his head darkly bright with seawater and sunlight. He wore a pilot&#x2019;s suit&#x2014;�iridescent, sleek, and permeable&#x2014;�that would dry as swiftly as bare skin in the hot breeze, but his hair he gathered up in his hands as he approached, wringing water out from the great length of it and wrapping it high on the crown of his head with a band from his wrist.<br><br>Recognition came to Dllenahkh gradually. At first, when the figure appeared, it was a pilot; then, as it began to walk, it was a familiar pilot; and finally, with that added movement of hands in hair, it was Naraldi, a man well known to him but not so well known as to excuse the early breaking of a retreat. He opened his mouth to chide him. Six more days, Naraldi! Could anything be so important that you could not wait six more days? That was what he intended to say, but another thought came to him. Even for a small planet with no docking station in orbit, it was highly uncommon for a mindship to splash down so close to land that a pilot could swim to shore. Although he knew Naraldi, they were not so close as to warrant a visit at this time and in this place.<br><br>The pilot slowed his step and looked uncertainly at him with eyes that streamed from the irritation of salt water.<br><br>&#x201c;Something terrible has happened,&#x201d; Dllenahkh said simply.<br><br>Naraldi wiped at his wet face and gave no reply.<br><br>&#x201c;My mother?&#x201d; Dllenahkh prompted to break the silence, dread growing cold and heavy in his stomach.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, your mother,&#x201d; Naraldi confirmed abruptly. &#x201c;Your mother, and my mother, and . . . everyone. Our home is no more. Our world is&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Dllenahkh shook his head, incredulous rather than upset at the bitterness and haste of Naraldi&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;What are you saying?&#x201d;<br><br>He remembered that he was still thirsty and tried to raise the bowl again, but in the meantime his hands had gone chilled and numb. The bowl slipped. He snatched at it but only deflected it so that it struck hard on the side of the water jug and broke just in time to entangle his chasing fingers.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; was all he said. The cut was so clean, he felt nothing. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry. Let me . . .&#x201d; He crouched and tried to collect the larger fragments but found himself toppling sideways to rest on one knee.<br><br>Naraldi rushed forward. He grasped Dllenahkh&#x2019;s bleeding right hand, yanked the band from his hair, and folded Dlle�nahkh&#x2019;s fist around the wad of fabric. &#x201c;Hold tight,&#x201d; he ordered, guiding Dllenahkh&#x2019;s left hand to clamp onto his wrist. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let go. I&#x2019;ll get help.&#x201d;<br><br>He ran off down the beach toward the temple. Dllenahkh sat down carefully, away from the broken bits of glass, and obediently held tight. His head was spinning, but there was one small consolation. For at least the length of time it took Naraldi to return, he would remember the words of the guestmaster: he would not be curious, he would not seek to know, and he would not worry about how to right the tumbled world.</p><h2>View From A Hill</h2><p>View From A Hill is the story of Mark Burgess, singer and founder member of legendary Manchester cult heroes The Chameleons. The band were catapulted to the forefront of the post-punk scene when John Peel awarded them a much coveted session after the band had played only a handful of low-key gigs. Mark takes us through four decades of pop culture as he charts The Chameleons&#39; development, as well as their cruel treatment at the hands of a corrupt music industry. Amidst intrigue in the Middle East, expeditions in search of the Loch Ness Monster, and acid trips that inspired the band&#39;s language and sound, there are myriad music industry anecdotes that will make your jaw drop. Moving and hilarious by turns, View From A Hill is a highly entertaining rollercoaster ride of a rock memoir. Previously only published in very limited print runs, this edition of Mark&#39;s autobiography represents the definitive version of the work. Completely revised and augmented by a full discography, Chameleons family tree, and an introduction by Karren Ablaze!, this book is a must for Chameleons fans everywhere.

After reading this book, young readers will be saying, "I spy great art!" Here's a seek-and-find book that invites youngsters to look at art in a special way: very closely! Whether it's a garden by Vincent van Gogh, a boat race by Thomas Eakins, or a peaceable kingdom by Edward Hicks, in this book each of the thirteen paintings, reproduced in full color, invites young children to explore works of art depicting a variety of outdoor scenes. <br><br>Written in simple rhyme with major works form The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, this book asks children to take a close, closer and closest look at classic fine art at an early age.</p><p>Jessica Schulte is a Project Editor at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. She lives in New York City.Gr. 2-4. Like the previous volumes by Judith Cressy in the Can You Find It? series, published in conjunction with the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this book has children look for specific items in a series of paintings. Unlike the previous volumes, in which a simple text on each spread lists things to pick out of the paintings, here rhymed couplets pose questions for children to answer. It would be easy to dismiss a book with rhymes like "Can you find it? Do you see? / A chicken perches by a tree. / Not so far, now look nearby / And see a horse who's staying dry. / Now get ready and get set / To find a wagon getting wet." On the other hand, it's hard to pass up a book with thirteen fine paintings that are accessible to children, beautifully reproduced, and (many of them) not often found in art books for young people. And unlike its companion, Schulte's <i>Can You Find It Inside?</i> it even includes a few nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century paintings of black and Asian subjects. On the last three pages, a small color reproduction of each picture appears along with information identifying the painting and the artist. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And then hesitantly, I added, &#x201c;You want to quiz me?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;JFK,&#x201d; she said. <br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s obvious,&#x201d; I answered. <br><br> &#x201c;Oh, is it now?&#x201d; she asked. <br><br> &#x201c;No. Those were his last words. Someone said, &#x2018;Mr. President, you can&#x2019;t say Dallas doesn&#x2019;t love you,&#x2019; and then he said, &#x2018;That&#x2019;s obvious,&#x2019; and then he got shot.&#x201d; <br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;God, that&#x2019;s awful. I shouldn&#x2019;t laugh. But I will,&#x201d; and then she laughed again. &#x201c;Okay, Mr. Famous Last Words Boy. I have one for you.&#x201d; She reached into her overstuffed backpack and pulled out a book. &#x201c;Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez. The General in His Labyrinth. Absolutely one of my favorites. It&#x2019;s about Sim�n Bol�var.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know who Sim�n Bol�var was, but she didn&#x2019;t give me time to ask. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a historical novel, so I don&#x2019;t know if this is true, but in the book, do you know what his last words are? No, you don&#x2019;t. But I am about to tell you, Se�or Parting Remarks.&#x201d; <br><br>And then she lit a cigarette and sucked on it so hard for so long that I thought the entire thing might burn off in one drag. She exhaled and read to me: <br><br> &#x201c;&#x2018;He&#x2019;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s Sim�n Bol�var&#x2014;&#x2018;was shaken by the overwhelming revelation that the headlong race between his misfortunes and his dreams was at that moment reaching the finish line. The rest was darkness. &#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; he sighed. &#x201c;How will I ever get out of this labyrinth!&#x201d;&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><br>I knew great last words when I heard them, and I made a mental note to get ahold of a biography of this Sim�n Bol�var fellow. Beautiful last words, but I didn&#x2019;t quite understand. &#x201c;So what&#x2019;s the labyrinth?&#x201d; I asked her. <br><br>And now is as good a time as any to say that she was beautiful. In the dark beside me, she smelled of sweat and sunshine and vanilla, and on that thin-mooned night I could see little more than her silhouette except for when she smoked, when the burning cherry of the cigarette washed her face in pale red light. But even in the dark, I could see her eyes&#x2014;fierce emeralds. She had the kind of eyes that predisposed you to supporting her every endeavor. And not just beautiful, but hot, too, with her breasts straining against her tight tank top, her curved legs swinging back and forth beneath the swing, flip-flops dangling from her electric-blue-painted toes. It was right then, between when I asked about the labyrinth and when she answered me, that I realized the importance of curves, of the thousand places where girls&#x2019; bodies ease from one place to another, from arc of the foot to ankle to calf, from calf to hip to waist to breast to neck to ski-slope nose to forehead to shoulder to the concave arch of the back to the butt to the etc. I&#x2019;d noticed curves before, of course, but I had never quite apprehended their significance. <br><br>Her mouth close enough to me that I could feel her breath warmer than the air, she said, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the mystery, isn&#x2019;t it? Is the labyrinth living or dying? Which is he trying to escape&#x2014;the world or the end of it?&#x201d; I waited for her to keep talking, but after a while it became obvious she wanted an answer. <br><br> &#x201c;Uh, I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said finally. &#x201c;Have you really read all those books in your room?&#x201d; <br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;Oh God no. I&#x2019;ve maybe read a third of &#x2019;em. But I&#x2019;m going to read them all. I call it my Life&#x2019;s Library. Every summer since I was little, I&#x2019;ve gone to garage sales and bought all the books that looked interesting. So I always have something to read. But there is so much to do: cigarettes to smoke, sex to have, swings to swing on. I&#x2019;ll have more time for reading when I&#x2019;m old and boring.&#x201d; <br><br>She told me that I reminded her of the Colonel when he came to Culver Creek. They were freshmen together, she said, both scholarship kids with, as she put it, &#x201c;a shared interest in booze and mischief.&#x201d; The phrase booze and mischief left me worrying I&#x2019;d stumbled into what my mother referred to as &#x201c;the wrong crowd,&#x201d; but for the wrong crowd, they both seemed awfully smart. As she lit a new cigarette off the butt of her previous one, she told me that the Colonel was smart but hadn&#x2019;t done much living when he got to the Creek. <br><br> &#x201c;I got rid of that problem quickly.&#x201d; She smiled. &#x201c;By November, I&#x2019;d gotten him his first girlfriend, a perfectly nice non&#x2013;Weekday Warrior named Janice. He dumped her after a month because she was too rich for his poverty-soaked blood, but whatever. We pulled our first prank that year&#x2014;we filled Classroom Four with a thin layer of marbles. We&#x2019;ve progressed some since then, of course.&#x201d; She laughed. So Chip became the Colonel&#x2014;the military-style planner of their pranks, and Alaska was ever Alaska, the larger-than-life creative force behind them. <br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re smart like him,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Quieter, though. And cuter, but I didn&#x2019;t even just say that, because I love my boyfriend.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re not bad either,&#x201d; I said, overwhelmed by her compliment. &#x201c;But I didn&#x2019;t just say that, because I love my girlfriend. Oh, wait. Right. I don&#x2019;t have one.&#x201d; <br><br>She laughed. &#x201c;Yeah, don&#x2019;t worry, Pudge. If there&#x2019;s one thing I can get you, it&#x2019;s a girlfriend. Let&#x2019;s make a deal: You figure out what the labyrinth is and how to get out of it, and I&#x2019;ll get you laid.&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;Deal.&#x201d; We shook on it. <br><br>Later, I walked toward the dorm circle beside Alaska. The cicadas hummed their one-note song, just as they had at home in Florida. She turned to me as we made our way through the darkness and said, &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re walking at night, do you ever get creeped out and even though it&#x2019;s silly and embarrassing you just want to run home?&#x201d; <br><br>It seemed too secret and personal to admit to a virtual stranger, but I told her, &#x201c;Yeah, totally.&#x201d; <br><br>For a moment, she was quiet. Then she grabbed my hand, whispered, &#x201c;Run run run run run,&#x201d; and took off, pulling me behind her.</p><h2>The Thousand and One Churches</h2><p><p>Published in 1909 and long out of print, <i>The Thousand and One Churches</i> remains a seminal study of the postclassical monuments of Anatolia.

You want anything, Cheri?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; her co-worker said without looking up from her computer. &#x201c;Are you getting this same strange reading on the Mazatlan cruise package?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Alissa said after checking the computer screen over Cheri&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;I got that reading when I tried to access the Alaska cruise package for the Andersens. But I&#x2019;m not ready to try again until after I&#x2019;ve had some coffee.&#x201d;<br><br>Cheri looked over the top of her glasses. &#x201c;We open in five minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know. I&#x2019;ll be back in four. Don&#x2019;t sell any cruise packages until then.&#x201d;<br><br>The line at Starbucks was shorter than usual. Alissa examined the pastries in the case. They had Cheri&#x2019;s favorite lemon bars this morning and lots of other incredible looking goodies.<br><br>She started her familiar mental workout. <i>Croissant. I want a croissant. But I shouldn&#x2019;t. Too much fat. I&#x2019;ll have a muffin. A low-fat blueberry. Or a bagel. I can have a bagel. A bagel with fat-free cream cheese.<br><br></i>&#x201c;What can I start for you?&#x201d; the young woman behind the counter asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>Alissa hesitated.<br><br>The customer behind her spoke up. &#x201c;Cappuccino and a croissant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me.&#x201d; Alissa turned to the casually dressed man behind her. &#x201c;I was next, and if you don&#x2019;t mind, I&#x2019;m in a hurry.&#x201d;<br><br>He wore his long brown hair with a crooked part down the middle. A soft cocoa stubble curved across his broad jaw, and his gaze struck her with intense clarity. Green eyes. Green like the grass after it rains.<br><br>&#x201c;So what took you so long?&#x201d; he said with a teasing smile.<br><br>Alissa raised her eyebrows and decided this must be his idea of a joke. Since she had moved to Pasadena seven months ago, she had met plenty of men who acted as if the world were their footstool, and therefore they could put up their feet whenever they wanted. Southern California was full of that sort.<br><br>Turning to the woman behind the counter, Alissa said calmly, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a tall caf� mocha, a lemon bar, and a cinnamon roll. Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>There was no point looking over her shoulder as she left Starbucks. The man with the intriguing green eyes wouldn&#x2019;t be watching her. Men used to watch her walk away. She could feel their gazes. Men used to offer to let her go first.<br><br>But that was thirty-two pounds ago. It had been far too long since a man had given her a second glance. Not that she blamed any of them. Much had changed in the life of Alissa Benson.<br><br>Wistfully, she remembered what it was like to be seventeen, sauntering through the sand at Newport Beach while everyone watched. That had been many summers ago, back when the ends of her long, blond hair had danced in the wind like the mane of a wild horse.<br><br>Today, a long, linen blazer covered her rounded hips, and her shoulder length, wavy blond hair was caught up in a twist, clipped flat against the back of her head. She rarely wore her blue tinted contact lenses anymore. Makeup was something she bothered with only on special occasions, of which there hadn&#x2019;t been many lately.<br><br>Alissa&#x2019;s live-in companion was a cat named Chloe, and her favorite weekend pastime was reading. At twenty-six she was living the life of a sixty-year-old. And she was safe.<br><br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s right here,&#x201d; Cheri said, motioning to Alissa as she opened the door. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll put you on hold, Mr. Brannigan.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Line two,&#x201d; Cheri said to Alissa. &#x201c;And your landlord is on line one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, terrific,&#x201d; Alissa muttered. She handed the pastry bag to Cheri. &#x201c;I picked up a little something for you.&#x201d;<br><br>A smile spread across Cheri&#x2019;s face. &#x201c;Did you bring me a lemon bar? You are a honey!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t touch my cinnamon roll!&#x201d; Alissa playfully responded as she slid behind her desk and reached for the phone. &#x201c;Good morning, Mr. Brannigan. Did your wife tell you I was able to reserve two nights for you at the Heathman?&#x201d;<br><br>With a few clicks on the computer keyboard, she tried to pull up the active file of the Brannigans as he said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve decided to stay three nights. Can you add one more night for us?&#x201d;<br><br>The computer screen froze. Alissa tapped on the keys. &#x201c;Certainly, Mr. Brannigan. May I call you back to confirm that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait for your call,&#x201d; Mr. Brannigan said.<br><br>Alissa knew he would. The Brannigans had to be the most active retired couple she knew. In good health and possessing excessive spending money, they traveled constantly. And with Alissa&#x2019;s efficiency and excessive good manners, she was their only travel agent.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay. Thank you, Mr. Brannigan. Good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cheri?&#x201d; Alissa said. &#x201c;Did we go off-line?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve called the repairman. I don&#x2019;t know what the problem is. I guess all we can do is take messages. Don&#x2019;t forget your landlord. Line one.&#x201d;<br><br>With a push of a button and a deep breath, Alissa picked up line one. &#x201c;Clawson Travel Agency. This is Alissa.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ms. Benson,&#x201d; the landlord said with forced friendliness. &#x201c;You have not responded to the notice we sent you last month. I have left messages on your machine at home, but you have not returned the calls. I found it necessary to call you at work to ask for a reply.&#x201d;<br><br>Alissa turned away from Cheri and the client who had just entered the shop and was seated in front of Cheri&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to need more time to decide.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid there isn&#x2019;t any more time. I must know today by five o&#x2019;clock.&#x201d;<br><br>Alissa heard the click as he hung up, but she kept the phone to her ear as if the answer she needed would come sometime after the dial tone. Her condo complex had been sold a month ago. The new owner required all renters to sign a new lease that included an increase of $150 a month and a minimum commitment of two years. Alissa had never lived anywhere for more than two years. It was a nice condo but not her dream home. During the past month she had found nothing else in her price range. Yet the two-year commitment scared her. She had already been in Pasadena and at the same travel agency for seven months. That in itself was almost a record.<br><br>She heard a slight rustling sound and realized a customer was now seated in front of her desk. &#x201c;Okay. We&#x2019;ll work on that and get back to you then,&#x201d; she said into the dumb receiver that she still held to her ear. &#x201c;Good-bye.&#x201d;<br><br>Turning to hang up and greet her customer, Alissa forced a smile back on her face and said, &#x201c;Yes, how can I&#x2014;&#x201d; She stopped. It was the guy from Starbucks. &#x201c;How can I help you?&#x201d;<br><br>He took a slow sip from his Starbucks cappuccino and looked at her with his grass green eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re having trouble with your computers this morning?&#x201d;<br><br>It crossed Alissa&#x2019;s mind that perhaps this guy had followed her here and somehow overheard Alissa and Cheri say they had computer problems. For a brief flash, Alissa felt flattered that this man had apparently sought her out.<br><br>&#x201c;Alissa?&#x201d; Cheri called over. &#x201c;Excuse me for interrupting, but Mr. Brannigan is on the phone again. Do you want to take it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; Alissa put on her headset. &#x201c;Excuse me a moment, please,&#x201d; she said to the green-eyed stranger. &#x201c;Yes, Mr. Brannigan?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My wife wanted me to ask about the special you advertised for the Alaskan cruise, but I forgot when I called earlier. Is there still room on the June trip?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m having difficulty accessing the information on those cruises this morning. Would it be all right if I called you back this afternoon? That way I&#x2019;ll know about the extra night at the Heathman as well.&#x201d;<br><br>Alissa hung up and turned her attention to the man at her desk. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you have local access, or do you have to go through a central clearing agency?&#x201d; Brad asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the cruises,&#x201d; he said, getting up and coming over to her side of the desk. &#x201c;Do you have a local server for your info? Pull up the file. That might tell me.&#x201d; He reached over Alissa&#x2019;s shoulder and clicked on a few keys.<br><br>His forward approach startled Alissa. First at Starbucks and now this. Who did this guy think he was? &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but I can&#x2019;t allow you to do this.&#x201d;</p><h2>Crystal Cave</h2><p><i>This is what happened. I saw it, and it is a true tale</i>.<br><br>So begins the story of Merlin, born the illegitimate son of a Welsh princess in fifth century Britain, a world ravaged by war. Small and neglected, with his mother unwilling to reveal his father's identity, Merlin must disguise his intelligence - and hide his occasional ability to know things before they happen - in order to keep himself safe.<br><br>One beautiful afternoon, while exploring the countryside near his home, Merlin stumbles across a cave filled with books and papers and hiding a room lined with crystals. It is the home of Galapas, who becomes Merlin's tutor and friend, and who teaches Merlin to understand the world around him... and to harness the power of the crystal cave to see the future.<br><br>Merlin will rise to power and enter history - and legend - as advisor to King Arthur. But all stories must begin somewhere. And this is his.<br><br><i>The Crystal Cave</i>is the first of Mary Stewart's brilliant Arthurian Saga, telling the story of King Arthur from the perspective of the extraordinary, mysterious Merlin.</p><p>Initially published nearly thirty years ago, Mary Stewart's <i>The Crystal Cave</i> has been spellbinding readers and converting them into serious Arthurian buffs ever since. The first in a series of four books, this novel focuses on the early life of Merlin the magician, and the political developments of fifth-century Britain. Not for the fainthearted, this verbose text pays careful attention to historical details and methodical plot development.<p> Merlin's childhood is formed by the absence of his reticent, convent-bound mother and his unnamed and unknown father. As the bastard grandson of a local king, Merlin is the object of both envy and ridicule. His strange powers and predictions earn him greater status as a pariah, and he leaves home as a preadolescent. Returning years later as a young man--empowered by self-knowledge and magic--Merlin finds himself caught in the currents of the shifting kingdoms.</p><p> As an established classic in this genre, and the first in a popular series, <i>The Crystal Cave</i> introduces this familiar character with fresh sensitivity. While readers looking for the romance of <i>First Knight</i> will be disappointed, those happy with tight writing and a complex story line will be satisfied. <i>--Nancy R.E. O'Brien</i></p>If you haven&#39;t read Mary Stewart&#39;s Arthurian Saga, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing. They are must reads for any romance reader, for any lover of Arthurian legend, for any history buff, for any voracious reader, and may be the books to get non-readers started. Basically, they should be read by everyone! Mary Stewart&#39;s research for these books is phenomenal. Her understanding of myth and its relationship to fact is remarkable. The books are complex, yet incredibly inviting and you will absolutely love the characters. They also weave together so beautifully that you won&#39;t be able to read only one. Two things I find particularly interesting in this series is the portrayal of Arthur and the fall of Camelot. Arthur represents all of humanity in these books as opposed to the more mythical figure you usually see. And the fall of Camelot is more internal rather than external--more about the passions and lusts in the heart rather than a more obvious loss of power. The books go in this order: The Crystal Cave, The Hollow Hills, The Last Enchantment, The Wicked Day. Shauna Summers, Senior Editor</p><h2>The God of Yes: How Faith Makes All Things New</h2><p><br>The Christian life is often defined as "no." What starts with a desire to reject descructive things morphs into a "no" to people, enjoyment, laughter, pleasure, success, and ultimately life itself. Before we know it, we've reduced the Christian faith to a huge rejection of just about everything God has created. Is it any wonder why many in our culture think of Christianity and "no" comes to mind?<br>We need perspective. We need more than just "no." We need to experience a divine "yes" to all of life as a gift from God.<br>Ecclesiastes, through Solomon's journals, gives us a huge dose of reality. Solomon's entire experience is a counterintuitive "yes" to God and every aspect of life. It provides a framework for a faith that squares off with reality and finds it infused with meaning.<br>THE GOD OF YES will explore this counterintuitive approach and provide clear application on how faith can infuse meaning to the monotony of everyday life. It will flip Ecclesiastes upside down to show that it is actually affirming life in all of its parts with God at the center. It will challenge the reader that his or her life can look different even if nothing changes externally.</p><p>Jud Wilhite is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author, speaker, and the senior pastor of Central Christian Church.

Everyone spends days preparing special foods, which are carried in a candlelight procession to the cemetery for a nightlong celebration of singing, dancing, and feasting at the graves of loved ones. A number of Spanish words and phrases are worked into Johnston's simple text, as the children are repeatedly told ``esp&#x201a;rense''--``wait''--when they try to sample the empanadas (meat pastries) or the pan de muertos (special ``bread of the dead,'' shaped like human figures and decorated with colored sugar). Winter's square acrylic paintings, in rich hues of green, pink, purple, blue, and gold, float within thick black borders that change with each turn of the page. The covers, endpapers, and title page are decorated with silhouettes reminiscent of the cut-paper banners that beautify the ofrendas, home altars bearing candles, fruit, flowers, and photographs of the departed.

Ripplinger's paintings are done in a realistic style somewhat similar to Andrew Wyeth's. In them, a young boy and his dog play through every season on farmlands, prairie fields, and country roads. He and his friends have a snowball fight in front of a large country house and board the school bus in a winter blizzard. The child walks in a creek bed in solitude and down the road beside his dad. For the most part, the accompanying verse is well written. The dialogue style works well rhythmically and makes for a possible story hour or program read-aloud. Adults would also enjoy this nostalgic piece that ends with the boy a grown farmer: "You see, my hair's mostly wind,/My eyes filled with grit,/My skin's red or brown,/My lips chapped and split." With its attractive format, this will make a nice additional purchase for poetry collections, though in prairie areas it might be a "must."?Susannah Price, Boise Public Library, ID<br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 3^-5, younger for reading aloud. The initial premise of the poem--if you're not from the prairie, you can't understand wind, cold, grasses, and such--mellows out by the end as "you" and "I" agree to understand each other because we share the same sun. The colorful acrylic paintings, however, draw you in immediately rather than insist that you can't understand. Ripplinger's images catch the vastness of prairie living, with a strong sense of the flat expanses of the horizon, and the vastness of the sky. This is a world of children on the prairie, physically lying on the land, playing in the mud, walking through the snow. The book affectionately shows farm life on flatland, wherever the land is. <i>Mary Harris Veeder</i></p><h2>Jamaica Inn</h2><p>Stark and forbidding, Jamaica Inn stands alone on bleak Bodmin Moor, its very walls tainted with corruption.

In 1931 her first novel, The Loving Spirit, was published. A biography of her father and three other novels followed, but it was the novel Rebecca that launched her into the literary stratosphere and made her one of the most popular authors of her day. In 1932, du Maurier married Major Frederick Browning, with whom she had three children.Many of du Maurier&#39;s bestselling novels and short stories were adapted into award-winning films, including Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds and Nicolas Roeg&#39;s Don&#39;t Look Now. In 1969 du Maurier was awarded a DBE.

There's the gasiness, constipation, queasiness, and exhaustion; the forgetfulness, crankiness, and the constant worry. Of course, no woman is spared these discomforts and humiliations, but most are too polite to complain or too embarrassed to talk about them. Not Jenny McCarthy!In <i>Belly Laughs</i>, the actress and new mother reveals the naked truth about the tremendous mood swings, the excruciating pains, and the unseemly disfigurement that go along with pregnancy. Never shy, frequently crude, and always laugh-out-loud funny, McCarthy covers it all in the grittiest of girlfriend detail. With tips and hilarious musings on morning sickness and hormonal rage, hemorrhoids, pregnant sex, and the torture and sweet relief that is delivery, Belly Laughs is must-read comic relief for anyone who is pregnant, who has ever been pregnant, is trying to get pregnant or indeed, has ever been born!</p><p><b>Jenny McCarthy</b> is the former host of the enormously popular MTV dating show <i>Singled Out</i>. She has starred in many films, including <i>Dirty Love</i>, the Sundance 2005 film that she also wrote. She is the mother of four year-old Evan and lives in Los Angeles.McCarthy, 1994 Playmate of the Year, actress (<i>Scream 3</i>; <i>Baywatch</i>; etc.) and former host of MTV's <i>Singled Out</i>, gave birth to her first child in 2002. Her pregnancy wasn't pretty&#x2014;and she wants to tell readers all about it. At the outset, she tells them, "If you bought this book, you are already aware of my frankness when it comes to certain things&#x2014;anatomy and bodily functions among them. If someone gave this book to you as a gift and you've never heard of me, apologies to you!" She goes on to recount the nitty-gritty of pregnancy in all its gory detail, covering morning sickness, hormonal rage, cravings, hemorrhoids, "engorged" breasts, gas, hot flashes, fainting spells, weight gain, acne, water retention and, finally, labor. McCarthy is undeniably crass but funny, and her candor and self-deprecation are refreshing. Each brief, chatty chapter focuses on a different&#x2014;and awful&#x2014;facet of pregnancy, with McCarthy relating personal anecdotes and usually winding down by reassuring women they're not alone. McCarthy's tales are, for the most part, a hoot, though they may offend more uptight readers. For example, in the beginning of McCarthy's pregnancy, she was constipated, so she visited a specialist. In the waiting room, the assistant called her name, and "everyone... looked up in surprise, and I knew what they were thinking: 'Jenny McCarthy has butt hole problems?' I was so embarrassed, until I realized that they had no right to be smirking: Those assholes were also there because of their own assholes.

Now the erudite essayist Kerry Howley makes her full-length debut in this sweaty but honorable tradition. She endows it with sly humor, trenchant vision and a curious twist on our concepts of genre. . . . Howley depicts it all with piercing skill. . . . Thrown is compulsively readable, informative, hilarious. . . . It is also a ferocious dissection of the essence of the spectator.&#x201d; <br>&#x2015;<em>New York Times Book Review</em><br><br>&#x201c;The most bizarre and fascinating book I&#x2019;ve read this year. . . . The precision of Howley&#x2019;s prose reminds me of Joan Didion or David Foster Wallace: she&#x2019;s so involved with the fight, it&#x2019;s as if she were trying to eat it with words. Howley writes like someone who&#x2019;s been flayed, all nerve endings exposed, no barriers between her and the world around her.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;Lev Grossman, <em>Time</em> magazine<br><br>"This sui generis debut threatens to remap the entire genre of nonfiction. . . .

Hilarious, sometimes tragic, and philosophical, Howley&#x2019;s first book is remarkably innovative and self-assured. It&#x2019;s a sly, unexpected and endlessly promising debut.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;NPR.org<br><br>"Howley manages to conjure the moments that make fights so thrilling.

Kerry Howley&#x2019;s , which spends three years inside the trenchant subculture of mixed martial arts cage fighting, following two men from desolate Des Moines fairgrounds to Vegas arenas and in worlds beyond as they battle to win and as they battle the unraveling of their separate lives, is both part of that tradition and an intimate, front-row look at two stories of hope, glory, and violence.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<em>Vogue</em><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Thrown</em> is the only MMA book anyone ever needs to write. . . .

The book is about fighting, yes, about an extreme sport and some of the men involved, who maybe aren&#x2019;t, after all, Odysseus or Hector, but possessing of a more earthbound sort of humanity and heroism. It&#x2019;s about the the strong pull of home, the powerful binds of blood, and the press, everpresent, of time.

Now, Turkey?s most beloved American scholar, John Freely, brings to life this charismatic hero of one of the richest histories in the world. Mehmet was barely twenty-one when he conquered Byzantine Constantinople, which became Istanbul and the capital of his mighty empire. Mehmet reigned for thirty years, during which time his armies extended the borders of his empire halfway across Asia Minor and as far into Europe as Hungary and Italy. Three popes called for crusades against him as Christian Europe came face to face with a new Muslim empire. Revered by the Turks and seen as a brutal tyrant by the West, Mehmet was a brilliant military leader as well as a renaissance prince. His court housed Persian and Turkish poets, Arab and Greek astronomers, and Italian scholars and artists. In the first biography of Mehmet in thirty years, John Freely vividly illuminates the man behind the myths.</p><p>John Freely was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1926. He teaches physics at Bosphorous University in Istanbul. He has written more than forty books, including The Lost Messiah, The Grand Turk, and Aladdin&#39;s Lamp.Mehmet II (1432&#x2013;1481) ascended to the throne of the Ottoman Empire when he was only 12. In spite of his youth, he had an energetic desire to rule the kingdom, physical prowess and a precocious intellect, which made him one of the most brilliant and most feared of all medieval Muslim rulers. In this alternately tedious and fast-paced chronicle, historian Freely, of Bosphorus University in Istanbul, shows Mehmet as cunning and politically and militarily astute. Mehmet turned his back on a peace treaty he had signed with emperor Constantine XI and attacked Byzantium's capital, Constantinople, capturing the city when he was barely 21. His troops looted much of the city and Mehmet, who reportedly shed tears at the destruction of such beauty, spent much of the rest of his reign rebuilding it. By 1463, Mehmet the Conqueror ruled the former dominions of the Byzantine Empire from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea. In one short chapter, Freely then rushes through roughly 450 years of history to the Ottoman Empire's end after WWI. Mehmet's colorful and dashing exploits deserve better than this colorless biography. B&amp;w illus., 2 maps. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Had he been born a few decades later, we might know him today as a multi-tasking celebrity stylist, as a coach on <em>Dancing with the Stars</em>, or perhaps as the fine artist he aspired to be.<br> <br> But Quaintance, who died in 1957, lived and worked during an era when homosexuality was repressed, when his joyful paintings and physique photos could not depict a penis. In an era before Stonewall, the sexual revolution, gay rights and the AIDS crisis, Quaintance and his high-camp erotic art existed in a demi-monde of borderline legality.<br> <br> Half a century on, the masculine fantasy world created by Quaintance, populated by Latin lovers, lusty cowboys and chiseled ranch hands, retains its seductive allure. His highly prized paintings&#x2014;numbering just 55&#x2014;rarely come to auction, instead selling privately for undisclosed sums. As the preeminent &#x2019;male physique&#x2019; artist of the 1940s and early &#x2019;50s, his work for<em> Physique Pictorial, Demi-Gods&nbsp;</em>and <em>Body Beautiful</em> inspired a generation of artists like <strong>Tom of Finland, Harry Bush, Etienne</strong>, and other, lesser stars in their constellation.<br> <br> Raised on a farm in rural Virginia, Quaintance traveled a fascinating path of reinvention: at various points in his life he was a Vaudeville dancer, the favored portraitist of Washington&#x2019;s smart set, and a celebrity hair designer&#x2014;though he never actually touched hair. &nbsp;<br> <br> <strong>TASCHEN&#x2019;s <em>Quaintance </em>traces his remarkable life story and reintroduces his colorful, kitschy and culturally resonant paintings&#x2014;works that made George Quaintance the most popular and successful physique artist of his time, and one of its most intriguing figures.</strong> &nbsp; Text in English, French, and German</p><p>Dian Hanson produced a variety of men&#x2019;s magazines from 1976 to 2001, including Juggs, Outlaw Biker and Leg Show, before becoming TASCHEN&#x2019;s Sexy Book editor.

In this Scottish folk song, a generous family always has room for another person and invites in everyone who passes by.</p><p>Say you're traveling across Scottish fields and a storm breaks out. Where do you stay for the night? Whether you're a tailor or a sailor or a gallowglass or a fishing lass, you'll be relieved to hear good Lachie MacLachlan shouting from his doorstep, "There's room galore. Och, Come awa' in! There's room for one more, always room for one more!" In this sing-song story, derived from an old Scottish nursery tale, Lachie's boundless magnanimity, while well-received, backfires. The welcoming chap invites all passersby into his home, until the wee house literally explodes with his goodwill. Luckily, the grateful visitors devise a plan to help Lachie and his family (and themselves as well).<p> Sorche Nic Leodhas tells Lachie's story in the lilting, rhyming brogue of a time-worn Scottish folktale. A glossary helps readers through the less intuitive dialect, and Loedhas also provides a musical score so the main chorus of the legend can be sung as originally intended. Nonny Hogrogian's illustrations combine intricately crosshatched line drawings with sponge smudges of moss and berry hues. The effect, impressive enough to earn Hogrogian the Caldecott Medal, is one of a dreamy, watery heath, populated by jovial elfin sprites. The generosity of this tale is addictive, and readers will love being welcomed into Lachie's fold, time and time again. <i>(Picture Book)</i></p><b>Sorche Nic Leodhas</b>, author of <i>Thistle and Thyme</i>, a Newbery Honor Book, turns to her childhood to retell this Scottish folktale that was passed on to her by her own grandfather.

Does the future of the church really lie with Pastor Jimmy of the Harmony Worship Center and sermons like "Ten Mutual Funds Jesus Would Die For"?

When Easter dawns, all will expect a miracle in Harmony.</p></p><p>In <i>Just Shy of Harmony</i>, Philip Gulley's follow-up novel to <i>Home to Harmony</i>, the award-winning author again offers matchless slices of small-town life as he catches us up on the doings of the quirky characters that inhabit this small community. Beloved minister Sam Gardner slides into depression as his little Quaker church, which once had goals of spreading the gospel and ending world hunger, now juggles such lofty issues as what type of vanity table to put in the ladies' restroom and the progress of its chicken noodle sales. Gulley gently pokes fun at evangelical Christianity's foibles through his characterizations, including church member Dale Hinshaw's "Scripture egg project" (chickens lay eggs with Scripture in the yolks to reach the unsaved). There are poignant moments: Wayne Fleming's wife Sally has deserted him and his three kids, and now Wayne is in love with lawyer Deena Morrison, owner of the Legal Grounds Coffee Shop. When Sally returns home, Wayne must make the most difficult decision of his life. Reading one of Gulley's stories is as comfortable as sitting in a rocking chair on the front porch, listening to an old friend spin tales.

The Key of the Mysteries represents the culmination of Lvi&#39;s thoughts and is written with subtle and delicate irony. It reveals the mysteries of religion and the secrets of the Qabalah, providing a sketch of the prophetic theology of numbers. The mysteries of nature, such as spiritualism and fluidic phantoms, are explored. Magical mysteries, the Theory of the Will with its 22 axioms are divulged. And finally it offers &#34;the great practical secrets.&#34; The true greatness of this work, however, lies in its ability to place occult thought firmly in Western religious traditions. For Lvi, the study of the occult was the study of a divine science, the mathematics of God.</p><p><p>Alphonse Louis Constant, better know by his pen name Eliphas Levi, was a master of the traditional Rosicrucian interpretation of the Kabbalah. He was born in France in 1810, and through the offices of the parish priest, was educated for the church at SaintSulpice. He was later expelled from seminary for teaching doctrines contrary to those of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1824 Levi began studying the occult sciences, and wrote about magic and the Kabbalah for the next three decades.

His most popular works by far have been the Elric novels. As editor of the controversial British science fiction magazine&nbsp;<i>New Worlds</i>, Moorcock fostered the development of the New Wave in the UK and indirectly in the U.S. He won the Nebula Award for his novella&nbsp;<i>Behold the Man</i>, which tells the story of a time traveler who takes on the role of Christ. He has also won the World Fantasy Award, the British Fantasy Award, and many others, and in 2008 was named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction Writers of America.<i>Book One <br></i>Is there a madman with a brain <br>To turn the stuff of nightmare sane <br>And demons crush and Chaos tame, Who&#x2019;ll leave his realm, forsake his bride <br>And, tossed by contradictory tides, <br>Give up his pride for pain? <br>The Chronicle of the Black Sword<br><i>Chapter One<br>A Doomed Lord Dying<br></i><br>It was in lonely Quarzhasaat, destination of many caravans but terminus of few, that Elric, hereditary emperor of Melnibon�, last of a bloodline more than ten thousand years old, sometime conjuror of terrible resource, lay ready for death. The drugs and herbs which usually sustained him had been used in the final days of his long journey across the southern edge of the Sighing Desert and he had been able to acquire no replacements for them in this fortress city which was more famous for its treasure than for its sufficiency of life.<br><br>The albino prince stretched, slowly and feebly, his bone-coloured fingers to the light and brought to vividness the bloody jewel in the Ring of Kings, the last traditional symbol of his ancient responsibilities; then he let the hand fall. It was as if he had briefly hoped the Actorios would revive him, but the stone was useless while he lacked energy to command its powers. Besides, he had no great desire to summon demons here. His own folly had brought him to Quarzhasaat; he owed her citizens no vengeance. They, indeed, had cause to hate him, had they but known his origins.<br><br>Once Quarzhasaat had ruled a land of rivers and lovely valleys, its forests verdant, its plains abundant with crops, but that had been before the casting of certain incautious spells in a war with threatening Melnibon� more than two thousand years earlier. Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s empire had been lost to both sides. It had been engulfed by a vast mass of sand which swept over it like a tide, leaving only the capital and her traditions, which in time became the prime reason for her continuing existence. Because Quarzhasaat had always stood there she must be sustained, her citizens believed, at any cost throughout eternity. Though she had no purpose or function, still her masters felt a heavy obligation to continue her existence by whichever means they found expedient. Fourteen times had armies attempted to cross the Sighing Desert to loot fabulous Quarzhasaat. Fourteen times had the desert itself defeated them. <br><br>Meanwhile the city&#x2019;s chief obsessions (some would say her chief industry) were the elaborate intrigues amongst her rulers. A republic, albeit in name only, and hub of a vast inland empire, albeit entirely covered by sand, Quarzhasaat was ruled by her Council of Seven, whimsically known as The Six and One Other, who controlled the greater part of the city&#x2019;s wealth and most of her affairs. Certain other potent men and women, who chose not to serve in this Septocracy, wielded considerable influence while displaying none of the trappings of power. One of these, Elric had learned, was Narfis, Baroness of Kuwai&#x2019;r, who dwelled in a simple yet beautiful villa at the city&#x2019;s southern extreme and gave most of her attention to her notorious rival, the old Duke Ral, patron of Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s finest artists, whose own palace on the northern heights was as unostentatious as it was lovely. These two, Elric was told, had elected three members each to the Council, while the seventh, always nameless and simply called the Sexocrat (who ruled the Six), maintained a balance, able to sway any vote one way or the other. The ear of the Sexocrat was most profoundly desired by all the many rivals in the city, even by Baroness Narfis and Duke Ral. <br><br>Uninterested in Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s ornate politics, as he was in his own, Elric&#x2019;s reason for being here was curiosity and the fact that Quarzhasaat was clearly the only haven in a great wasteland lying north of the nameless mountains dividing the Sighing Desert from the Weeping Waste. <br><br>Moving his exhausted bones on the thin straw of his pallet, Elric wondered sardonically if he would be buried here without the people ever knowing that the hereditary ruler of their nation&#x2019;s greatest enemies had died amongst them. He wondered if this had after all been the fate his gods had in store for him: nothing as grandiose as he had dreamed of and yet it had its attractions. <br><br>When he had left Filkhar in haste and some confusion, he had taken the first ship out of Raschil and it had brought him to Jadmar, where he had chosen willfully to trust an old Ilmioran drunkard who had sold him a map showing fabled Tanelorn. As the albino had half-guessed, the map proved a deception, leading him far from any kind of human habitation. He had considered crossing the mountains to make for Karlaak by the Weeping Waste but on consulting his own map, of more reliable Melnibon�an manufacture, he had discovered Quarzhasaat to be significantly closer. Riding north on a steed already half-dead from heat and starvation, he had found only dried river-beds and exhausted oases, for in his wisdom he had chosen to cross the desert in a time of drought. He had failed to find fabled Tanelorn and, it seemed, would not even catch sight of a city which, in his people&#x2019;s histories, was almost as fabulous. <br><br>As was usual for them, Melnibon�an chroniclers showed only a passing interest in defeated rivals, but Elric remembered that Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s own sorcery was said to have contributed to her extinction as a threat to her half-human enemies: A misplaced rune, he understood, uttered by Fophean Dals, the Sorcerer Duke, ancestor to the present Duke Ral, in a spell meant to flood the Melnibon�an army with sand and build a bulwark about the entire nation. Elric had still to discover how this accident was explained in Quarzhasaat now. Had they created myths and legends to rationalize the city&#x2019;s ill-luck entirely as a result of evil emanating from the Dragon Isle? <br><br>Elric reflected how his own obsession with myth had brought him to almost inevitable destruction. &#x201c;In my miscalculations,&#x201d; he murmured, turning dull crimson eyes again towards the Actorios, &#x201c;I have shown that I share something in common with these people&#x2019;s ancestors.&#x201d; Some forty miles from his dead horse, Elric had been discovered by a boy out searching for the jewels and precious artifacts occasionally flung up by those sandstorms which constantly came and went over this part of the desert and were partially responsible for the city&#x2019;s survival, as well as for the astonishing height of Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s magnificent walls. They were also the origin of the desert&#x2019;s melancholy name. <br><br>In better health Elric would have relished the city&#x2019;s monumental beauty. It was a beauty derived from an aesthetic refined over centuries and bearing no signs of outside influence. Though so many of the curving ziggurats and palaces were of gigantic proportions there was nothing vulgar or ugly about them; they had an airy quality, a peculiar lightness of style which made them seem, in their terracotta reds and glittering silver granite, their whitewashed stucco, their rich blues and greens, as if they had been magicked out of the very air. Their luscious gardens filled marvelously complex terraces, their fountains and water courses, drawn from deep-sunk wells, gave tranquil sound and wonderful perfume to her old cobbled ways and wide tree-lined avenues; yet all this water, which might have been diverted to growing crops, was used to maintain the appearance of Quarzhasaat as she had been at the height of her imperial power and was more valuable than jewels, its use rationed and its theft punishable by the severest of laws. <br><br>Elric&#x2019;s own lodgings were in no way magnificent, consisting as they did of a truckle bed, straw-strewn flagstones, a single high window, a plain earthenware jug and a basin containing a little brackish water which had cost him his last emerald. Water permits were not available to foreigners and the only water on general sale was Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s single most expensive commodity. Elric&#x2019;s water had almost certainly been stolen from a public fountain. The statutory penalties for such thefts were rarely discussed, even in private.<br>Elric required rare herbs to sustain his deficient blood but their cost, even had they been available, would have proven far beyond his present means, which had been reduced to a few gold coins, a fortune in Karlaak but of virtually no worth in a city where gold was so common it was used to line the city&#x2019;s aqueducts and sewers. His expeditions into the streets had been exhausting and depressing. <br><br>Once a day the boy who had found Elric in the desert, and brought him to this room, paid the albino a visit, staring at him as if at a curious insect or captured rodent. The boy&#x2019;s name was Anigh and, though he spoke the Melnibon�an-derived lingua franca of the Young Kingdoms, his accent was so thick it was sometimes impossible to understand all he said.<br>Once more Elric tried to lift his arm only to let it fall. That morning he had reconciled himself to the fact that he would never again see his beloved Cymoril and would never sit upon the Ruby Throne. He knew regret, but it was of a distant kind, for his illness made him oddly euphoric. <br><br>&#x201c;I had hoped to sell you.&#x201d; <br><br>Elric peered, blinking, into the shadows of the room on the far side of a single ray of sunlight. He recognized the voice but could make out little more than a silhouette near the door.<br>&#x201c;But now it seems all I have to offer in next week&#x2019;s market will be your corpse and your remaining possessions.&#x201d; It was Anigh, almost as depressed as Elric at the prospect of his prize&#x2019;s death. &#x201c;You are still a rarity, of course. Your features are those of our ancient enemies but whiter than bone and those I have never seen before in a man.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to disappoint your expectations.&#x201d; Elric rose weakly on his elbow. He had deemed it imprudent to reveal his origins but instead had said he was a mercenary from Nadsokor, the Beggar City, which sheltered all manner of freakish inhabitants.<br>&#x201c;Then I had hoped you might be a wizard and reward me with some bit of arcane lore which would set me on the path to becoming a wealthy man and perhaps a member of the Six. Or you might have been a desert spirit who would confer on me some useful power. But I have wasted my waters, it seems. You are merely an impoverished mercenary. Have you no wealth left at all? Some curio which might prove of value, for instance?&#x201d; And the boy&#x2019;s eyes went towards a bundle which, long and slender, rested against the wall near Elric&#x2019;s head.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s no treasure, lad,&#x201d; Elric informed him grimly. &#x201c;He who possesses it could be said to bear a curse impossible to exorcize.&#x201d; He smiled at the thought of the boy trying to find a buyer for the Black Sword which, wrapped in a torn cassock of red silk, occasionally gave out a murmur, like a senile man attempting to recall the power of speech. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a weapon, is it not?&#x201d; said Anigh, his thin, tanned features making his vivid blue eyes seem large. <br><br>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; Elric agreed. &#x201c;A sword.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;An antique?&#x201d; The boy reached under his striped brown djellabah and picked at the scab on his shoulder. <br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a fair description.&#x201d; Elric was amused but found even this brief conversation tiring. <br><br>&#x201c;How old?&#x201d; Now Anigh took a step forward so that he was entirely illuminated by the ray of sunlight. He had the perfect look of a creature adapted to dwell amongst the tawny rocks and the dusky sands of the Sighing Desert. <br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps ten thousand years.&#x201d; Elric found that the boy&#x2019;s startled expression helped him forget, momentarily, his almost certain fate. &#x201c;But probably more than that . . .&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s a rarity, indeed! Rarities are prized by Quarzhasaat&#x2019;s lords and ladies. There are those amongst the Six, even, who collect such things. His honour the Master of Unicht Shlur, for instance, has the armour of a whole Ilmioran army, each piece arranged on the mummified corpses of the original warriors. And my Lady Talith possesses a collection of war-instruments numbering several thousands, each one different. Let me take that, Sir Mercenary, and I&#x2019;ll discover a buyer. Then I&#x2019;ll seek the herbs you need.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Whereupon I&#x2019;ll be fit enough for you to sell me, eh?&#x201d; Elric&#x2019;s amusement increased. <br><br>Anigh&#x2019;s face became exquisitely innocent. &#x201c;Oh, no, sir. Then you will be strong enough to resist me. I shall merely take a commission on your first engagement.&#x201d;<br>Elric felt affection for the boy. He paused, gathering strength before he spoke again. &#x201c;You expect I&#x2019;ll interest an employer, here in Quarzhasaat?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Naturally.&#x201d; Anigh grinned. &#x201c;You could become a bodyguard to one of the Six, perhaps, or at least one of their supporters. Your unusual appearance makes you immediately employable! I have already told you what great rivals and plotters our masters are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It is encouraging&#x2014;&#x201d; Elric paused for breath&#x2014;&#x201c;to know that I can look forward to a life of worth and fulfillment here in Quarzhasaat.&#x201d; He tried to stare directly into Anigh&#x2019;s brilliant eyes, but the boy&#x2019;s head turned out of the sunlight so that only part of his body was exposed. &#x201c;However, I understood from you that the herbs I described grew only in distant Kwan, days from here&#x2014;in the foothills of the Ragged Pillars. I will be dead before even a fit messenger could be halfway to Kwan. Do you try to comfort me, boy? Or are your motives less noble?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I told you, sir, where the herbs grew. But what if there are some who have already gathered Kwan&#x2019;s harvest and returned?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;You know of such an apothecary? But what would one charge me for such valuable medicines? And why did you not mention this before?&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Because I did not know of it before.&#x201d; Anigh seated himself in the relative cool of the doorway. &#x201c;I have made enquiries since our last conversation. I am a humble boy, your worship, not a learned man, nor yet an oracle. Yet I know how to banish my ignorance and replace it with knowledge. I am ignorant, good sir, but not a fool.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I share your opinion of yourself, Master Anigh.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Then shall I take the sword and find a buyer for you?&#x201d; He came again into the light, hand reaching towards the bundle. <br><br>Elric fell back, shaking his head and smiling a little. &#x201c;I, too, young Anigh, have much ignorance. But, unlike you, I think I might also be a fool.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Knowledge brings power,&#x201d; said Anigh. &#x201c;Power shall take me into the entourage of the Baroness Narfis, perhaps. I could become a captain in her guard. Maybe a noble!&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, one day you&#x2019;ll surely be more than either.&#x201d; Elric drew in stale air, his frame shuddering, his lungs enflamed. &#x201c;Do what you will, though I doubt Stormbringer will go willingly.&#x201d;</p><h2>Once Upon a Time in Italy: The Westerns of Sergio Leone</h2><p>An illustrated exploration of the mid-twentieth-century filmmaker&#39;s &#34;spaghetti westerns&#34; considers his role in defining the genre, his visual style and elliptical storytelling methods, and his creation of such works as A Fistful of Dollars and Once Upon a Time in the West. 12,500 first printing.</p><p>Sir Christopher Frayling has been rector at London&#39;s Royal College of Art since 1996 and a professor of cultural history for more than 20 years. He is the author of more than a dozen books on arts and culture, including Spaghetti Westerns and Sergio Leone: Something to Do with Death. He is currently chairman of the Arts Council of England.Of Sergio Leone (1929&#x2013;1989) and his legendary spaghetti westerns, director Martin Scorsese says, "he created a new genre... a major departure for Italian cinema." Frayling's history of Leone's life and work is a testament to that creation, an all-encompassing and carefully compiled book for fans and students. Besides telling the story of Leone's rise (in 1964, he made <i>A Fistful of Dollars </i>on $200,000 and some leftover film stock), the book contains interviews with composer Ennio Morricone, star Clint Eastwood and Leone himself. Morricone explains that he wrote musical scores for Leone's films without a script, drawing only on the story and Leone's take on the characters. Eastwood defines Leone's westerns as operatic, and great movie villain Lee Van Cleef reveals that he turned down a role in the now classic and critically revered <i>Once Upon a Time in the West</i> because he didn't like the way it was written. Along with intriguing comments by writers and directors, and an essay by Leone about his idol, John Ford, this work provides visually arresting production stills, lobby cards, pictorial source sketches, costume and set designs and posters. This is a work of scholarship and depth on the Italian western and the man who pioneered it. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As prayer moves into the center stage of Western medicine <i>Prayer Is Good Medicine</i> acts as a modern-day prayer book as well as an ethical touchstone for healers and seekers.<p>Larry Dossey, M.D., is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <em>Healing Words,</em> and <em>Prayer Is Good Medicine.</em> An authority on spiritual healing, he lectures throughout the country and has been a frequent guest on <em>Oprah, Good Morning America, CNN,</em> and <em>The Learning Channel.</em> He is responsible for introducing innovations in spiritual care to acclaimed institutions across the country.

Unlike Edvard Radzinsky in his magisterial Last Tsar (1992)- -which depicted Nicholas as doting, charming, and ineffectual--and Marc Ferro in Nicholas II (p. 274)--which portrayed the Russian ruler as a politically naive, pleasure-loving king in the tradition of Louis XVI--Lieven presents Nicholas as an anachronism, a patriarchal leader crippled by tradition, bureaucracy, and an inability to deal with the social and technological changes that challenged his authority. As a political leader, Lieven says, Nicholas failed to deal with the abysmal poverty of the peasants and overreacted to the ``Yellow Peril,'' expending resources in a wasteful and remote war with Japan. Surrounded by a bureaucracy, as well as by a jealous and petty aristocracy, he ran the government as a family business that both isolated him from the contemporary world and caused him to fritter away his time on trivia: This ruler of 150 million had no personal secretary and answered all his own correspondence. Rasputin gained power, Lieven explains, because he represented the faith of the peasants, on which Nicholas relied. By comparing Nicholas with other monarchs in Japan, Germany, and especially Persia (in the figure of the shah, whom Nicholas resembled in many personal ways), Lieven introduces an international context to explain the inevitability of the tsar's destruction in a terrible incongruence of time, temperament, and talent. In the chapter dealing with Nicholas's execution, the author displays a skill at dramatic writing that's equal to his cool and dispassionate political analysis--an analysis that culminates in his discussion of the relevance of Nicholas to Russia's struggle to recover its sense of identity after the collapse of Communism. A rare balance of personal and political insight: timely and persuasive. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Twenty years later, they have performed live for four presidents and have recorded 20 CDs of their songs.<br></p><p>Cofounders William Strauss and Elaina Newport have been The Capitol Steps&#39;s principal writers, director and producer.

Elaina Newport lives in Arlington, Virginia.These former and current congressional staffers have come a long way--from the halls of power to, well, the halls of power. For their quip- and innuendo-filled song parodies, pointed as a Sam Donaldson question to a dallying president, have brought them full circle as they entertain our government and others. Whether they're skewering past administrations or present, the fun and melodious Steps bring laughter as they bid George W. to "Don't Go Pretending You're Smart" (to the tune of "Don't Go Breaking My Heart") and "Stand by Your Dan," sung by Mrs. Quayle to the tune of Tammy Wynette's classic.

Now it's back, in an anniversary edition reprint. The narrator, Sasha Davis, an Ohio girl, high school prom queen, now divorced and in a second marriage "headed for the same miserable demise as the first," is still searching for herself. Touching on issues that continue to color the cultural landscape -- abortion, date rape, balancing work and motherhood -- Memoirs was, for some readers, what the Saturday Review (May 20, 1972) called a "break-through book," the "first important novel to emerge from the Women's Liberation movement." </p><p>The Post's reviewer, Barbara Howar (April 26, 1972), took the messages of the book personally: "With uncomfortable frequency, I find myself torn between the warring factions of the Women's Rights Movement and its natural enemy, the Great White Male. So grand is my passion for both that I resent having to take sides which it becomes my sticky business to do in commenting on this first novel. . . . Heroine Sasha recounts with heavy humor her blundering quest for autonomy in a male-oriented society . . . terrorized by bullying, domineering little boys who grew into big ones.</p><p>"Having been a Prom Queen a time or two, I can readily share Sasha's rage at being pushed into beauty-worship before she gets the message that a woman just might need something more in life than the identity of the man she marries. . . . </p><p>"Sasha refuses to see that her parents as well as the goodly number of men in her life are victimized by the same system that did her in, that we are all in the soup together. . . . </p><p>"After this cathartic memoir, my guess is that Alix Shulman will get her sense of humor and fair-play into some less paranoid perspective and write a constructive book better suited to her talent and to the vast army of troubled women who need her." </p><p>Shulman has written three other novels, several children's books, two books on Emma Goldman and two memoirs, A Good Enough Daughter and Drinking the Rain. </p><p>Copyright 2007, The Washington Post.

His logic? "[P]utting my spin on it makes it Tuscan for me, because I'm Tuscan." That faulty reasoning is made even more glaring by Casella's complaint that the adjective Tuscan has been bastardized by its application to "kitchen design, olive oil, even classical music." That said, Casella's food&#x2014;wherever it comes from&#x2014;is quite delicious, and consists mainly of terrific rustic choices, like Potato and Egg Frittata, with its chunks of pancetta; and Tuscan Fried Chicken served with fried herbs. Casella writes like a restaurant chef, for better and for worse. On one hand, he generously shares recipes for some of the highlights on Beppe's menu, such as homemade <i>pinci</i> pasta in walnut and anchovy sauce, and Tuscan spareribs. On the other hand, he blithely calls for hard-to-find ingredients like pork liver, and while his Basic Pasta Dough recipe yields 1 3/4 pounds of dough, the three ravioli recipes that follow each call for 1 1/2 pounds of dough, with no suggestions as to what to do with the extra. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I&#x2019;m going to be rich!&#x201d; I screamed as I burst uninvited into my parents&#x2019; bathroom waving a copy of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> in the air.<br>I was twelve years old and, like a lot of other boys growing up on Long Island, usually spent most of what little money I had on baseball cards. That was until that morning, when I came to the realization that, for years, I had been throwing my allowance away on a mass-produced pseudo-investment that would likely never substantially increase in value. Much of my adolescence had been spent analyzing baseball player stats and negotiating card trades with friends and fellow collectors at swap meets&#x2014;and for what? Even my prized 1984 baseball card set had barely appreciated in value for two years! I had mistaken a hobby for investing. When I realized this, I swore that the industry would never get another dime of my hard-earned money. I decided it was time I graduated to the big leagues of investing.<br>Hopping atop my parents&#x2019; bathroom vanity that early December morning, I ripped open <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> to enlighten my father on my groundbreaking discovery.<br>Amid pages of micro-type stock quotes I had encircled the stock symbol for Toys&#x201c;R&#x201d;Us.<br>&#x201c;Twenty-two days till Christmas!&#x201d; I announced. &#x201c;Just think of all the Christmas and Hanukkah toys parents will be buying in the next few weeks! I&#x2019;m telling you, Dad, this is a sure thing!&#x201d;<br>I then handed my father a fist-size roll of $1 and $5 bills&#x2014;representing months of hoarding my allowance and birthday cash&#x2014;and urged him to help me facilitate the purchase of stock in Toys&#x201c;R&#x201d;Us. &#x201c;Quick, Dad! Call your broker!&#x201d;<br>My father, a lawyer, had limited investing experience, but he was wise enough not to take my money. Instead, he taught me an important lesson in stock investing I would never forget. He explained that the price of Toys&#x201c;R&#x201d;Us stock already reflected all widely known information about the company including past, present, and anticipated future sales. I learned that the price of the company&#x2019;s stock, much like the stock price of other companies that benefit from holiday sales, does not go up in value each holiday season&#x2014;as investors already anticipate that the company will sell more toys at that time of year. A decade later I would relearn this lesson while studying the &#x201c;efficient markets theory&#x201d; in business school. The theory asserts that it is not possible for a person to achieve investment returns greater than average market returns, given the information publicly available at the time of the investment.<br>&#x201c;But then how do you know,&#x201d; I asked my father, &#x201c;when to buy a company&#x2019;s stock?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That depends,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;The very best time to buy a company&#x2019;s stock is when you think you know something about that company that others don&#x2019;t. Otherwise, picking stocks at random gives you as good a chance of picking winners as any stock-picking strategy. Never let anyone tell you different.&#x201d;<br>I had heard all I needed to hear. I had a wad of cash burning a hole in my pocket and I was eager to get in the big-money game of investing. So, with my eyes closed, and chanting, &#x201c;Eeeny, meeny, miney, mo,&#x201d; I picked my first-ever stock investment. And as dumb luck would have it, just a few months later the small energy company whose stock I purchased at random from the paper that day was acquired at a stock price nearly double what I&#x2019;d paid. Little did I know at the time that I would go on to spend the greater part of my teen years trying to repeat that initial investing success.<br>EASY COME, EASY GO<br>In the months and years that followed that first investment, I would learn that easy money can be as much a curse as a blessing. Perhaps you have heard stories about lottery winners losing their multimillion-dollar fortunes just a few years after hitting the big jackpot. For me it was the same story, just with a smaller pot. I might have had only a few hundred dollars of made money to lose, but that represented all the money I had in the world.<br>My dad had explicitly warned me not to let &#x201c;beginner&#x2019;s luck&#x201d; go to my head. &#x201c;Lightning,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;rarely strikes twice in the same spot.&#x201d; But not surprisingly, being an almost-teenage know-it-all, I wasn&#x2019;t listening to what I didn&#x2019;t want to hear. What did he know, anyway? My dad was a lot of things, but a risk taker was not one of them. Neither he nor my mom believed in shortcuts.<br>Dad was born and raised in the South Bronx and studied very hard to earn a full-ride scholarship to Fordham University, where he graduated number one in his class. He then spent twenty-two years as a corporate attorney at JCPenney, where he slowly worked his way up the ladder to become the company&#x2019;s head of litigation, and eventually executive vice president and general counsel of its life insurance division.<br>My mother received her master&#x2019;s degree in education, and after many years working endless hours as a teacher and school administrator, she became principal of a small Catholic school in a low-income Hispanic neighborhood&#x2014;an often difficult yet gratifying job she thoroughly enjoyed. The straight-and-narrow path of hard work and patience paid off for both my parents, providing them with the financial means to raise me and my three siblings in upper-class neighborhoods.<br>Yet, while we were far from poor, my parents were solely reliant on compensation from their careers as a means to building wealth. Investing just wasn&#x2019;t something they did. My dad had a stockbroker only out of necessity, to process the corporate stock grants he occasionally received from his company.<br>My parents&#x2019; lack of income diversity made them slaves to their employers. In 1988, when JCPenney suddenly announced it was relocating the company&#x2019;s headquarters from Manhattan to a plot of uninhabited farmland on the border of Texas and Oklahoma, we were left with no other option than to leave our extended family and friends to start a new life two thousand miles away from everything we had ever known. The move tore my large close-knit family in half, both physically and emotionally; we had lived in close proximity for generations.<br>I was in eighth grade at the time and was forced to change schools mid-year. It was not an easy transition. I was an Italian American kid with a thick &#x201c;Noo Yawk&#x201d; accent who had grown up in an ethnic melting pot in the predominantly Jewish neighborhood of Great Neck, Long Island. The people and terrain of Texas were as unfamiliar to me as China would have been.<br>At that first dreaded cafeteria school lunch west of the Mississippi, I reluctantly took a seat next to a group of my new classmates, some of whom were sporting Field &amp; Stream or Ducks Unlimited baseball caps and chewing tobacco. A note was passed to me from across the table. It read, &#x201c;Interstate 35 North&#x2014;Go Home, Yankee.&#x201d;<br>It would be a full year before I adjusted my wristwatch from Eastern to Central Standard Time. I refused to accept my new life as permanent. I was intent on getting my old life back, and if I could find a shortcut to doing so, all the better. My parents taught us to believe that the fruits of success came only with hard work. But look where all that hard work had gotten us. I might have been only thirteen at the time, but I had tasted the fruits of success in the stock market and I wanted more of it. A lot more! I knew that with enough of it, I could buy my old life back&#x2014;and never again be at the mercy of others.<br>WASH AND REPEAT<br>As a result of that first stock investment, in just a few months I had doubled my savings to nearly $1,000. The stock market would be my ticket out of the hell that was my new life. But I knew it would take a lot more than $1,000 to convince my dad to quit his job and move the family back home to New York. I calculated that if I could just repeat my last investment success and double my $1,000 ten times in a row, I would have a million dollars&#x2014;easy enough to achieve. So with the newspaper&#x2019;s Business section in hand, eyes closed, I yet again picked a stock at random and proceeded with the next phase of my investment experiment.<br>I don&#x2019;t remember the name of my second, third, or fourth stock picks. Needless to say, my father was right. That first stock pick had been just blind luck after all. Clearly I couldn&#x2019;t just &#x201c;will&#x201d; myself to fortune with wishful thinking. Don&#x2019;t get me wrong. I still believed the stock market to be my golden ticket, but I realized that I would have to step up my investing strategy.<br>LEARNING THE HARD WAY<br>I became obsessed. I read all the investing books, and soon knew every <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Barron&#x2019;s</i> columnist by name. There wasn&#x2019;t an investment type (stocks, bonds, commodities) or trading strategy (growth, value, momentum) I didn&#x2019;t try.<br>I recall riding my BMX bike home one summer afternoon from the Dallas commodities exchange while balancing a one-hundred-ounce bar of silver bullion on the handlebars. I had just finished reading a book about the Hunts, one of the world&#x2019;s wealthiest families. They tried to corner the global silver market in the 1970s by amassing more than two hundred million ounces of the metal, equivalent to half the world&#x2019;s deliverable supply.<br>Unfortunately, my own silver experiment was ultimately more of a novelty than an investment. My $500 silver bar appreciated only $12 in eight months, and if I had held onto it, my investment would have been worth roughly the same amount ten years later. Unless you are seeking an investment that could also serve as the world&#x2019;s most interesting and expensive paperweight, I would leave commodities to the professional speculators.<br>By the time I turned sixteen, CNBC had become my MTV, and &#x201c;money honey&#x201d; finance anchor Maria Bartiromo was my Pamela Anderson. I had become a human sponge for all things financial. If I learned anything worth remembering about investing during those teenage years, it was what drove other people to buy and sell stocks. It was this insight into Wall Street&#x2019;s investing behavior that would eventually empower me to crack the black box of investing success for myself.<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Chris Camillo<br></p><h2>The morality of consent</h2><p>Morality Of Consent, The by Bickel, Alexander M.</p><p></p><h2>Transforming Leadership: The Pursuit of Happiness</h2><p>An award-winning historian critically examines the role of leadership in the twenty-first century, outlining a program of &#34;Transforming Leadership,&#34; through which leaders can become agents of positive social change. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>James MacGregor Burns is senior scholar at the Jepson School of Leadership Studies at the University of Richmond and Woodrow Wilson Professor of Political Science Emeritus at Williams College. He is the author of numerous books, including Transforming Leadership, The American Experiment, The Deadlock of Democracy, Roosevelt: The Lion and the Fox, Roosevelt: The Soldier of Freedom, and The Three Roosevelts (with coauthor Susan Dunn).Twenty-five years after the publication of Leadership, Burns expands upon his theories about how leaders cultivate their successors to explore how they create environments conducive to social and personal development. He distinguishes between "transactional" leaders, who thrive on cutting deals, and "transforming" leaders, whose sweeping changes totally revamp political institutions. Although the book relies on a variety of historical examples, it devotes particular attention to Franklin Roosevelt, about whom Burns has written extensively in the past (The Lion and the Fox; The Soldier of Freedom). Burns's underlying theory imagines leadership as part of a broader social process in which leaders and followers are closely interrelated. Starting with psychologist Abraham Maslow's theories of the hierarchy of human needs, the book suggests leaders attain their power through their responsiveness to others' desires for security, self-esteem and personal development, putting themselves in a position to "create and expand the opportunities that empower people to pursue happiness for themselves." As such, leadership is an inherently positive process, distinguishable from tyranny by the latter's inability to promote liberty and equality. Amusing asides, in which Burns describes how he attempted to apply his understanding of leadership principles to raising his children, enliven the scholarly consideration of leadership's evolution over the centuries. These accessible anecdotes, as well as Burns's explications of historical examples, will ensure the book's influence extends beyond its most obvious implications for political science.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The MindBody Self: How Longevity Is Culturally Learned and the Causes of Health Are Inherited</h2><p>In these turbulent times, just about every solution you can think of has been put forth by someone, somewhere, as a way to calm the waters and live with more happiness and ease.

That was substantially a mythological analysis of the Christian system, introduced by a discussion of mythological principles in that particular connection and in general. The bulk of the present volume is substantially a synthesis of Christian origins, introduced by a discussion of the principles of hierology. Such discussion is still forced on sociology by the special pleaders of the prevailing religion. But the central matter of the book is its attempt to trace and synthesise the real lines of growth of the Christian cultus.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Systematic Theology, Vol. Three: Life in the Spirit</h2><p><p>Emphasizing the beliefs common to all branches of Christendom rather than the issues that divide, Thomas Oden brings the full weight of two millennia of discussion to bear on the ever-contemporary questions of Christian faith. His magisterial study not only treats the traditional elements of systematic theology, referencing hundreds of theologians&#x2014;Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, charismatic&#x2014;but also highlights the foundational exegetes of history. Broadly ecumenical in the truest sense of the word, and written from the perspective of a theological liberal-turned-evangelical, Oden's direct, frank, and provocative approach articulates the concerns of a broad spectrum of Christians&#x2014;pastors, teachers, seminarians, and thoughtful laity.</p><p>Though comprehensive in scope, the set is arranged in a Trinitarian fashion with each volume focusing on one person of the godhead. The first volume explores the Christian understanding of God, creation and providence. The second volume discusses Christ and the Incarnation. The third volume considers the presence of the Holy Spirit in history, and his power in the lives and communities of present day believers.</p><p>� Volume 1: <i>The Living God </i>[ISBN 9781598560374]<br>� Volume 2: <i>The Word of Life</i> [ISBN 9781598560381]<br>� Volume 3: <i>Life in the Spirit</i> [ISBN 9781598560398]<br>These volumes may be purchased separately.</p><p>&#x201c;Demonstrates a commitment of faithfulness to the scriptural teachings concerning Jesus and a rich appreciation for the classical and conciliar traditions of Christology.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Preaching</i></p><p>&#x201c;Oden's project is anti-trendiness with a vengeance . . . refreshingly bold.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>First Things</i></p><p>&#x201c;The most impressive systematic exercise in ecumenical &#x2018;consensual thinking&#x2019; in print.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Religious Studies Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;A welcome addition to the pastor's bookshelf and a needed voice in the contemporary theological conversation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<i>Interpretation</i></p></p><p>The final volume in a three-volume systematic theology by a major American theologian.<p><b>Thomas C.

Now, with The Crusader, Kengor returns with the one book about Reagan that has not been written: The story of his lifelong crusade against communism, and of his dogged&#x2013;and ultimately triumphant&#x2013;effort to overthrow the Soviet Union. </p><p> Drawing upon reams of newly declassified presidential papers, as well as untapped Soviet media archives and new interviews with key players, Kengor traces Reagan's efforts to target the Soviet Union from his days as governor of California to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of what he famously dubbed the "Evil Empire." The result is a major revision and enhancement of what historians are only beginning to realize: That Reagan not only wished for the collapse of communism, but had a deep and specific understanding of what it would take&#x2013;&#x2013;and effected dozens of policy shifts that brought the USSR to its heels within a decade of his presidency.</p><p> The Crusader makes use of key sources from behind the Iron Curtain, including one key memo that implicates a major American liberal politician&#x2013;still in office today&#x2013;in a scheme to enlist Soviet premier Yuri Andropov to help defeat Reagan's 1984 reelection bid. Such new finds make The Crusader not just a work of extraordinary history, but a work of explosive revelation that will be debated as hotly in 2006 as Reagan's policies were in the 1980s.</p></p><p><p>Paul Kengor is the author of the <em>New York Times</em> extended-list bestseller <em>God and Ronald Reagan</em> as well as <em>God and George W. Bush</em> and <em>The Crusader</em>. He is a professor of political science and director of the Center for Vision and Values at Grove City College. He lives with his wife and children in Grove City, Pennsylvania.</p>In this hagiographic account, political scientist Kengor (<i>God and Ronald Reagan</i>) makes the familiar case (made most recently by John Lewis Gaddis in <i>The Cold War</i>) that Reagan played a decisive role in ending the Cold War. Reagan was troubled by communism well before he arrived at the White House. As a young man in Hollywood, he railed against the red threat, and as early as 1967, he called for the destruction of the Berlin Wall. As president, Reagan engaged in "economic warfare," invaded Grenada and proved that the Soviets couldn't win an arms race against the U.S. Though "those enslaved by the Soviet Communist state" didn't find freedom until after the Reagan administration, Dutch gets the credit. And what of other major figures who contributed to the Cold War's end? Gorbachev, of course, figures prominently, and John Paul II makes significant appearances&#x2014;Kengor credits the pope with helping turn Reagan's attention to Poland. Ted Kennedy, on the other hand, emerges as a sneak and a dupe, willing to undermine U.S. foreign policy and make nice with the Russians. The book's structure is somewhat stilted&#x2014;each chapter is broken up into short chunks, so it feels as though one is reading not a sweeping narrative, but an annotated time line of Reagan's presidency. While the book is workmanlike, the chronology is useful and the footnotes reveal an impressive amount of research. <i>(Oct. 17)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kaye </b>was a British author who was born in India and spent much of her childhood and adult life there. She became world famous with the publication of her monumental bestseller, <i>The Far Pavilions.</i> She authored a series of mysteries as well as the bestselling <i>Trade Wind</i> and <i>Shadow of the Moon</i>.Originally published in England, this tale of romance and murder on a few tiny islands in the Indian Ocean was written in the '30s and is based on an actual experience of the then-young author. Copper Randal is visiting Valerie, a school friend who is the daughter of the commissioner of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal. The British community there is small and eccentric, its predictable social rounds occasionally enlivened by visiting naval officers. A Christmas Eve picnic is interrupted by a raging tropical storm, during which an indigent British plantation owner is killed. A visiting Navy doctor voices suspicion of murder and is the next victim. With communications to the mainland cut, the storm still in force, terror takes over the island as the search for motive turns up a surprising number of suspects. One is handsome Nick Tarrent, friend of Valerie's fiance and object of Copper's troubling romantic fantasies. With its satisfying plot, deft characterization and emphasis on setting and atmosphere, this early effort from an established talent is both fresh and credible. 40,000 first printing. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crafting for Cat Ladies: 35 Purr-fect Feline Projects</h2><p><b>For cat-crazy crafters, these 35 unique projects are absolutely purr-fect! </b><br> Sweet and trendy, creative and fun to make, the crafts are divided into four sections&#x2014;accessories, apparel, home, and party.

It is, like Hunt's Illuminations (S &amp; S, 1989), a reflection of the ideas and world view of the medieval centuries, a time when the Earth seemed full of mysterious beasts and travelers wrote tales of fantastic adventures. The author's extensive research into the history of bestiaries (as evidenced by his appended note and the lengthy bibliography) has yielded 26 brightly colored, action-filled illustrations of wondrous, and mostly fearsome, creatures. Familiar legendary beasts such as the griffin, phoenix, and sphinx share the pages with the ichneumon, ozaena, ziphius, and other curiosities. A pronunciation guide on the first page helps readers with the names, and a brief paragraph under each neatly framed picture explains the powers and peculiar habits of the storied creatures. A decorative map on the endpapers shows the known world of the Middle Ages and the location of each reported marvel. Fun to read because of the fabulous creatures and the accounts of their often-bizarre appetites and reported ferocity, this book offers an engaging pictorial supplement to studies of the Middle Ages or units on legends and myths.<br><i>Shirley Wilton, Ocean County College, Toms River, NJ</i><br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this companion to Hunt's Illuminations, fearful horrors mix with benevolent beasts, populating an alphabet book that should provide many hours of discovery. Hunt explains how fantastic animals were combined with actual ones in bestiaries, and why; he gives reasonable explanations for the curious inventions of these imaginary creations. After a map of the medieval world, every entry in the alphabet is given a page or a spread, as in the case of the ``most feared'' creature of the ocean depths, the Kraken. Among the beasts are the firedrake, the basilisk, the nycticorax, and an intriguing unicornfar different from the glowing white steed-like creature of most lore. Hunt's tone is steady and somber, whether the information is horrible, whimsical, or medicinal in nature (e.g., ``a griffin's feather could cure blindness''). The details are entertaining, scary, and marvelous. A long author's note attests to Hunt's enthusiasm, and a bibliography underscores his scholarship, but readers will be delighted most by his two renderings of the not-so- mythical beast known as an artist, shown once in medieval garb and working with quills, and once in blue jeans, perched on an articulated office chair.

Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down &#x2014; all across the globe. Though the world is far from perfect, necessities and luxuries alike are getting cheaper; population growth is slowing; Africa is following Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping are enriching people&#x2019;s lives as never before. The pessimists who dominate public discourse insist that we will soon reach a turning point and things will start to get worse. But they have been saying this for two hundred years. </p><p>Yet Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. Prosperity comes from everybody working for everybody else. The habit of exchange and specialization&#x2014;which started more than 100,000 years ago&#x2014;has created a collective brain that sets human living standards on a rising trend. The mutual dependence, trust, and sharing that result are causes for hope, not despair. </p><p>This bold book covers the entire sweep of human history, from the Stone Age to the Internet, from the stagnation of the Ming empire to the invention of the steam engine, from the population explosion to the likely consequences of climate change. It ends with a confident assertion that thanks to the ceaseless capacity of the human race for innovative change, and despite inevitable disasters along the way, the twenty-first century will see both human prosperity and natural biodiversity enhanced. Acute, refreshing, and revelatory, <em>The Rational Optimist</em> will change your way of thinking about the world for the better. </p><p>Matt Ridley is the award-winning, bestselling author of several books, including&nbsp;<em>The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves</em>; <em>Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters</em>; and <em>The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature</em>.

Visit him at stevensalerno.comPreSchool-Grade 2&#x2014;This newly illustrated story (originally published by Golden Bks. in 1951) recounts the madcap efforts of a pastry-loving poodle to be hired at a local bakery. Pantaloon, zipping around the city on a shiny red bicycle and decked out in snazzy striped pants, answers a Help Wanted sign only to be rebuffed, even in clever disguise. But when Baker lands in bed, bruised and bumped from tripping over Pantaloon's misplaced bicycle, the remorseful pup swoops in to save the day by completing all the orders. Pantaloon is an overnight sensation with the customers, who clamor for his return. Baker pleads for Pantaloon to come back in letters on a giant cake in the store window, and they become "the two happiest bakers in the whole world." The final illustration, a coda to the text, bears a visual clue to Pantaloon's inevitable success. While the story line is slight and often contrived, the stylized, retro-looking full-color illustrations are snappy and appealing, and breathe new life into this classic for another generation. A worthy choice for storytime read-alouds.&#x2014;<i>Kathleen Finn, St. Francis Xavier School, Winooski, VT</i> <br>(c) Copyright 2010.

Together they have written the critically acclaimed bestsellers Inferno, Footfall, and The Legacy of Heorot, among others. The Mote in God&#x2019;s Eyes is their acknowledged masterpiece, an epic novel in mankind&#x2019;s first encounter with alien life that transcends the genre.</p><p>In the year 3016, the Second Empire of Man spans hundreds of star systems, thanks to the faster-than-light Alderson Drive. No other intelligent beings have ever been encountered, not until a light sail probe enters a human system carrying a dead alien. The probe is traced to the Mote, an isolated star in a thick dust cloud, and an expedition is dispatched.<p> In the Mote the humans find an ancient civilization--at least one million years old--that has always been bottled up in their cloistered solar system for lack of a star drive. The Moties are welcoming and kind, yet rather evasive about certain aspects of their society. It seems the Moties have a dark problem, one they've been unable to solve in over a million years.</p><p> This is the first collaboration between Niven and Pournelle, two masters of hard science fiction, and it combines Pournelle's interest in the military and sociology with Niven's talent for creating interesting, believable aliens. The novel meticulously examines every aspect of First Contact, from the Moties' biology, society, and art, to the effects of the meeting on humanity's economics, politics, and religions. And all the while suspense builds as we watch the humans struggle toward the truth. <i>--Brooks Peck</i></p>Larry Niven trained as a mathematician.

This great photographer (Vanishing Africa; Vanishing Amazon) presents an intimate account of Africa to the reader and viewer with such sincerity that it may be experienced first-hand, unadulterated. The book centers on East Africa, only occasionally veering into other parts of the continent. Through stories and commentaries as well as pictures, the people emerge full of life and emotions, the landscape flows as the stage for their lives, and the reader gets a subtle lesson in history. Anyone interested in African adventure and travel should at least peruse this work once. Unlike Ricciardi, Turner (Pete Turner Photographs) allows the camera to do all the talking through 140 images capturing the outrageous natural beauty, simple humanity, and intriguing past of Africa. Turner lives not just by the power of his lenses; he composes with the intuition of a painter and the empathy of an anthropologist. The resulting images display a depth of color, imagery, and perspective that can only come with commitment to a mission and an affinity for the scenes and people being photographed. The simplicity of indigenous folks and the vivacity and range of the colors displayed in clothing, buildings, ornaments, objects, landscape, and wildlife transform this volume into a splendid work of art. Turner's pictures speak in a way that words often cannot. His book is recommended for all public libraries, while Ricciardi's is recommended for both public and academic libraries.DEdward K.

A specialist on the Templars, the Crusades, and the papacy, she earned her Ph.D. at the University of Venice. She lives in Viterbo, Italy.Founded just after the First Crusade, the Knights of the Temple was a military-religious order subject only to the pope and dedicated to Christian rule of the Holy Land. It lasted beyond the fall of the Crusader states by becoming a bank for Western Europe&#x2019;s superwealthy. Choosy about lending, the Templars frustrated French king Philip IV, who in 1307 had every Templar he could reach condemned by the Inquisition and arrested. He didn&#x2019;t tell Pope Clement V because he was still smarting from Boniface VIII&#x2019;s censuring him for taxing and trying to bring the French church under his control. Clement eventually disbanded the Templars, and Philip executed its leaders, but its property went to another military order. Clement didn&#x2019;t condemn the order, however, and didn&#x2019;t say why, though it was long rumored that he had interrogated the leaders. In September 2001, Frale found the record of that interrogation. She discloses its revelations immediately, which doesn&#x2019;t vitiate the ensuing historical overview. Indeed, consider this little book the first-choice primer on its legend-laden subject. --Ray Olson</p><h2>If I Can&#39;t Have You: Susan Powell, Her Mysterious Disappearance, and the Murder of Her Children</h2><p><p><b>In <i>If I Can't Have You</i>, bestselling author Gregg Olsen and co-author Rebecca Morris investigate one of the 21st Century's most puzzling disappearances and how it resulted in the murder of two children by their father.</b><br><b></b><br>Every once in a great while a genuine murder mystery unfolds before the eyes of the American public. The tragic story of Susan Powell and her murdered boys, Charlie and Braden, is the only case that rivals the Jon Benet Ramsey saga in the annals of true crime. When the pretty, blonde Utah mother went missing in December of 2009 the media was swept up in the story &#x2013; with lenses and microphones trained on Susan's husband, Josh. He said he had no idea what happened to his young wife, and that he and the boys had been camping in the middle of a snowstorm.</p><p>Over the next three years bombshell by bombshell, the story would reveal more shocking secrets. Josh's father, Steve, who was sexually obsessed with Susan, would ultimately be convicted of unspeakable perversion. Josh's brother, Michael, would commit suicide. And in the most stunning event of them all, Josh Powell would murder his two little boys and kill himself with brutality beyond belief.</p></p><p><p>A <i>New York Times</i> and USA Today bestselling author, GREGG OLSEN has written nine nonfiction books, ten novels, a novella, and contributed a short story to a collection edited by Lee Child.</p><p>REBECCA MORRIS is an award-winning journalist who has worked in broadcast and print journalism in New York City; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle, Washington.</p>1 <br>Every moment I step back and take stock of what I&#x2019;m dealing with, it feels like a never ending cycle but I&#x2019;m too afraid of the consequences, losing my kids, him kidnapping [them], divorce or actions worse on his part&nbsp;&#x2026; <br>&#x2014;SUSAN POWELL E-MAIL, JULY 5, 2008 <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Debbie Caldwell pulled up in her Ford Club Wagon&#x2014;the one with fifteen seats to carry all the children who attended her day care&#x2014;and observed how quiet her friend and neighbor Susan&#x2019;s house seemed. It was 9:00 A.M. on Monday, December 7, 2009, and West Valley City, a suburb of Salt Lake City, was in the middle of a three-day winter storm. Freezing temperatures and four inches of new snowfall made the roads so icy that the local news described the streets as &#x201c;mayhem.&#x201d; <br>Susan, twenty-eight, and Josh, thirty-three, usually dropped Braden and Charlie at Daydreams &amp; Fun Things Child Care as early as 6:00 A.M. When they didn&#x2019;t appear that morning, Debbie started trying to reach the young parents. Susan was always prompt and conscientious. Josh was another story. He tested Debbie&#x2019;s patience regularly, bringing the children late&#x2014;which complicated the morning, since Debbie needed to know how many children needed breakfast. He also neglected to pick up the boys on time in the evening, cutting into Debbie&#x2019;s time with her own family. <br>The other day-care parents avoided Josh because he talked incessantly and acted as if he was an expert on anything and everything. They had a nickname they called Josh behind his back: <i>Rocks for Brains.</i> One day, when Josh had given Debbie a hard time because Braden had lost his socks, one of the mothers said, &#x201c;That idiot must have rocks for brains.&#x201d; It stuck. <br>Charlie and Braden, ages four and two, respectively, had been attending Debbie&#x2019;s day care for a year and a half, and like many women who had met the outgoing Susan, Debbie had become a confidante. Susan and her circle of friends were young, committed Mormon wives. Their children and their marriages came first. The friends had heard, because Susan told them, that Josh wouldn&#x2019;t give her money to buy groceries and diapers, wouldn&#x2019;t have sex with her, and wouldn&#x2019;t go to counseling. One friend joked that Josh treated his pet parrot better than his wife and sons. Susan also voiced displeasure that he was spending too many hours on the phone talking with his father, who had left the Mormon church. Steve Powell, Susan told her friends, had been inappropriate with her&#x2014;disgustingly so. Susan was so open with her complaints that her friends were feeling a bit apathetic. They&#x2019;d heard it all so many times. <br>That morning, Debbie, forty-seven and the mother of four daughters, was on her way home from dropping the older children at school. She still had three toddlers in the car, and as she parked the van in front of 6254 W. Sarah Circle she told them she would just be a minute. She knocked on the front door several times. No answer. She expected to find Josh, harried anytime he had the slightest responsibility, getting the boys dressed, or more likely sequestered on his computer in the basement where he liked to hide. In any case, Susan would have phoned Debbie if there had been a change in plans. <br>By the time Debbie was at the Powells&#x2019; front door Monday morning, she had already called Susan on her cell phone. When there was no answer, she tried Susan&#x2019;s work phone at Wells Fargo Investments and, finally, their home landline. <br>Again, no answer. <br>Debbie dialed Josh&#x2019;s employer, Aspen Distribution, a trucking and shipping firm where he did computer programming. They said that Josh hadn&#x2019;t shown up for work. When no one answered the front door of their house, she phoned the name listed as Josh and Susan&#x2019;s emergency contact, his sister, Jennifer Graves. <br>&#x201c;Hi Jennifer, this is Debbie Caldwell, Josh and Susan&#x2019;s day-care person,&#x201d; she said when she got Jennifer&#x2019;s voice mail. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nine o&#x2019;clock. I&#x2019;m at Josh and Susan&#x2019;s house. No one is home, and they didn&#x2019;t drop Charlie and Braden off this morning. Do you know what&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d; <br>A few minutes later, Josh&#x2019;s mother, Terrica (Terri) Powell, heard the message. A quiet woman who never really got back on her feet after the divorce from her husband Steve, she lived with her daughter Jennifer, her son-in-law Kirk Graves, and the couple&#x2019;s five children fifteen minutes south in West Jordan, Utah. <br>Terri conferred with Jennifer and they went over to the house. Finding it locked up tightly they tried both Josh&#x2019;s and Susan&#x2019;s cell phones, which went to voice mail. Then Terri phoned the West Valley City police to report the family missing. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The Powell residence looked like hundreds of others in West Valley City; maybe thousands. It was a white tract home with blue trim and blue shutters, and some stonework in the front. There was a tiny porch, a bay window, and a two-car garage. In the front yard was a wooden swing Josh had built for their two little boys. In back was playground equipment a neighbor had lent the family and a dormant vegetable garden. The garden wasn&#x2019;t a mere hobby for Susan, it was a necessity. Occasionally its produce was the only thing Josh allowed his family to eat. Susan sometimes called friends to ask if she could borrow some hot dogs. <br>&#x201c;The boys are hungry,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d say. <br>Within minutes of Debbie&#x2019;s call of concern, Josh&#x2019;s sister Jennifer met the police at the Powell house. The police logged it as a &#x201c;welfare check&#x201d; call. Jennifer, a soft-spoken woman with long, brown hair and her father&#x2019;s blue eyes, was shaken. There was fresh snow on the driveway and the steps to the door. After accounting for Debbie&#x2019;s tracks, it was clear that no one had been in or out of the house for at least several hours. When police knocked and got no answer, she gave them permission to break a window. They all braced themselves. Salt Lake City had just had several deaths attributed to carbon monoxide poisoning caused by faulty furnaces and that was on their minds as they entered the house. There was loud music blaring from a stereo and two box fans were angled to blow air on a damp spot on the carpet and a love seat near the front window. <br>At first there was a sense of relief: Josh and Susan and the boys were <i>not</i> dead in their beds. But something was wrong. <br> <i>They weren&#x2019;t home at all. Where were they?</i> <br>Jennifer went into the master bedroom. Despite the clutter, she noticed Susan&#x2019;s blue leather purse on a table by the foot of the bed. It contained her wallet, credit cards, and keys. There was no cell phone. The house was messy, but that was normal. There was no sign of forced entry or a robbery, home invasion, or struggle. Susan&#x2019;s red nylon snow boots, which she wore whenever she left the house, were in the living room. <br>West Valley City police issued a statewide attempt-to-locate bulletin so that law enforcement in other jurisdictions would be on the lookout for the Powells&#x2019; 2005 light blue Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan. The police sent Jennifer home so they could search the house. <br>Jennifer called Susan&#x2019;s father, Chuck Cox, in Puyallup, Washington, nine hundred miles to the northwest, to ask if he had heard from Susan or Josh. He hadn&#x2019;t, but he wasn&#x2019;t alarmed. Josh was known to make impulsive, last-minute decisions and the family liked to go rock hunting or camping. Yet, Chuck agreed it was odd that neither Susan nor Josh had called their places of employment or day-care provider to say that they&#x2019;d be away. <br>Jennifer phoned her father&#x2019;s house, also in Puyallup, and talked to her younger sister, Alina. Jennifer believed that Susan had moved to get away from her father, Steve, because Susan said he had made sexual advances toward her. In the background, Jennifer could hear her father talking while she asked Alina if they had heard from Josh and Susan. Alina asked everyone in the house, but no one had heard from Josh or Susan. <br>Jennifer called Kiirsi Hellewell, Susan&#x2019;s best friend, who lived down the street from the Powells. Kiirsi hadn&#x2019;t talked to Susan since Sunday, when they had walked home from church together. <br>&#x201c;Susan didn&#x2019;t say they were going anywhere,&#x201d; Kiirsi told Jennifer. <br>Kiirsi then phoned the Relief Society president&#x2014;the head of their ward&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s group&#x2014;and the two of them joined Jennifer at the Powell house and talked to the police. <br>&#x201c;I was still thinking at that time that maybe they went for a drive because Susan had posted on her Facebook page that they had gone to a work party on Saturday night and Josh had won a camera,&#x201d; Kiirsi remembered some time later. &#x201c;I thought, &#x2018;Well, it would be just like them to drive up in the mountains and take pictures.&#x2019;&#x201d; Then she began to imagine a different kind of threat than the carbon monoxide poisoning Jennifer and the police had feared. &#x201c;Maybe they slid off a cliff and they&#x2019;re all dead at the bottom of it or stuck on some back road. Because knowing Josh, he&#x2019;d drive on some back road in fresh snow.&#x201d; <br>Word spread among friends and church members that the Powell family was missing. In the early afternoon Kiirsi sent a text message to JoVonna Owings, who knew Susan from the church choir. <br> <i>Susan, Josh and the boys are missing. We don&#x2019;t know where they are. They haven&#x2019;t been seen since church.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>But JoVonna Owings <i>had</i> seen the family. She&#x2019;d been with them Sunday afternoon and would be critical to piecing together Susan&#x2019;s last hours. <br>If our lives can be read in our faces, JoVonna&#x2019;s said she had lived a tough life. Although she was about the same age as Susan&#x2019;s mother, JoVonna was thin and wizened and appeared older. She had a huge heart and wore big glasses that nearly gobbled her face. After church on Sunday she had helped Susan with some crocheting and had supper with the family. Josh had even cooked&#x2014;an unheard-of event. JoVonna was the last person to have contact with Josh and Susan on Sunday&#x2014;and would be the first to have contact with Josh on Monday. <br>At about 3:00 P.M. on Monday JoVonna phoned Josh. There was no answer. Her son Alex, who occasionally babysat for Charlie and Braden, punched in Josh&#x2019;s number on his phone. Josh answered, but Alex panicked and hung up without speaking. JoVonna grabbed her son&#x2019;s phone and redialed. He answered again. <br>&#x201c;Josh, where are you?&#x201d; JoVonna asked. &#x201c;What are you doing? The police are looking for you.&#x201d; <br>Josh, who could be an absolute motor mouth, was silent for a moment. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re driving around.&#x201d; <br>JoVonna felt her heart race. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Susan?&#x201d; <br>Josh paused a beat. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s at work.&#x201d; He went on to stammer out that he and the boys had gone camping overnight without Susan. <br>JoVonna was frustrated. &#x201c;No, she&#x2019;s not at work. We&#x2019;re really worried, Josh. You didn&#x2019;t go to work.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I got confused,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I thought it was Sunday.&#x201d; <br>JoVonna felt he was lying and pressed him. <br>&#x201c;No, you didn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;You knew it was Monday. Don&#x2019;t you tell me that. You need to get home, Josh, right now.&#x201d; <br>Immediately after getting off the phone with JoVonna, Josh checked his voice mail. Two minutes later he left Susan a message on her phone, which was on the seat beside him. <br>For the next two hours he answered no calls and drove nearly twenty miles around West Valley City, stalling. He washed his van at a do-it-yourself place where he could soap and scrub the car over and over, far more thoroughly than a drive-through car wash would. <br>At 5:27 P.M. Jennifer tried to call Josh but got no answer. <br>At 5:36 P.M. Josh left Susan a message on her phone&#x2014;still on the seat beside him. <br>At 5:43 P.M. Josh called Susan&#x2019;s phone again to say he was in the parking lot of the Wells Fargo building where she worked and asked if she needed a ride home. <br>At 5:48 P.M. Jennifer finally heard from her brother. She was home, talking to Chuck Cox at the moment, and she told him to listen in and stay quiet while she put the call on speaker. <br>&#x201c;Where are you, Josh?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m at work,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lying,&#x201d; she said, knowing he hadn&#x2019;t gone to work. &#x201c;Where are the boys?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re safe,&#x201d; he said. <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Susan?&#x201d; Jennifer continued. <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Work, I guess.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, Josh,&#x201d; Jennifer said. &#x201c;We know that&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How much do you know?&#x201d; Josh asked. <br>Now she felt real fear. <br>&#x201c;Why would you ask that? Josh, what have you done? What did you do to her?&#x201d; Jennifer asked. <br>Josh hung up. <br>Just then Chuck, whose job with the FAA had taught him to question much of what he saw and heard, went into full-on investigative mode. <br>&#x201c;Write down whatever you heard,&#x201d; he said to Jennifer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll write down what I heard, and we&#x2019;ll have our notes because we have to document this.&#x201d; <br>Jennifer drove back to Josh&#x2019;s house in West Valley City, hoping to confront him as soon as he arrived. <br>Chuck immediately started to log notes about what he had overheard. He thought Josh&#x2019;s end of the conversation was peculiar. <br> <i>The boys were safe? What kind of answer was that to where he&#x2019;d been?</i> <br>Chuck and Judy Cox, parents of four daughters, grandparents of nine children, married thirty-five years and no fans of Josh or his father Steve, were alarmed. Something bad had happened. <br> <i>Maybe Josh and Susan had a fight, he hurt her accidentally,</i> Chuck thought. <i>Maybe he stashed her somewhere and someone is going to find her. She&#x2019;ll come home and we&#x2019;ll deal with it then.</i> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>As soon as Jennifer arrived at the house and told West Valley City Police Department Detective Ellis Maxwell of her conversation with Josh, he borrowed her phone and called Josh, and when Josh answered, Maxwell told him to come home. Josh said that he needed to stop and get his children something to eat first. <br>At 6:40 P.M. Josh finally pulled his minivan into the driveway. The police kept father and sons in the vehicle while they questioned him. Josh said he and Charlie and Braden had left just after midnight to go camping and Susan was in bed. He had no idea where she might be now. He repeated that he had been confused and thought it was Sunday. Once he realized it was Monday, he hadn&#x2019;t called his employer because he was afraid he would lose his job if he admitted he had mixed up the days. <br>When asked why he hadn&#x2019;t answered his cell phone during the day, Josh said he had kept it off to preserve the battery. He said he didn&#x2019;t have a cell charger. Plus they were out in the desert where there was no service. Detective Maxwell, a solidly built man with a dark crew cut, mustache, and ruddy complexion, had fifteen years on the force but this would be the most complicated and trying case of his career. Maxwell leaned through the window of the minivan and saw one phone on the center consul plugged into a charger. He also noted a second cell phone&#x2014;later determined to be Susan&#x2019;s&#x2014;in the van. Josh didn&#x2019;t have an answer as to why his wife&#x2019;s phone was in the car. <br>Jennifer called Chuck to tell him that Josh and the boys had returned from a &#x201c;late night camping trip.&#x201d; And, Jennifer told Chuck, Josh didn&#x2019;t know where Susan was. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>After being trapped by the police in his driveway, Josh followed Detective Maxwell to the West Valley City Police Department to tell his story once more. The police wanted Charlie and Braden to come to the station, too. <br>The recorded interview began at 7:15 P.M. with Detective Maxwell, Josh, Charlie, and Braden in a room. During the two-hour interview, Braden and Charlie can be heard in the background wanting a soda, which Josh forbids. Finally, a victim advocate takes the boys out of the room to watch them and keep them occupied. <br>Asked to relate the events of Sunday...</p><h2>Algebra 1 2018, Teacher Edition, Volume 2</h2><p>Brand new, Ships from NY</p><p></p><h2>The Meditator&#39;s Workbook: A Journey to the Center</h2><p>Using hands-on exercises, journal entries, guided meditations, and lively vignettes, <i>The Meditator's Workbook</i> will help you:<br> <ul> <li>Live more deeply and joyfully in the moment </li><li>Uncover the true source of stress </li><li>Resolve grief </li><li>Explore and express forgiveness </li><li>See through the inevitable distortions of the mind </li><li>Recognize and actualize your goals </li><li>Find real inner peace and a thoroughgoing well-being </li></ul><br>Whether your goal is to reduce stress or to gain deeper insight and mastery over your inner life, this simple, straightforward guidebook is the tool to use for learning why and how to meditate.

Dame Frevisse joins forces with her old partner in sleuthing, Master Joliffe Norreys, when the duke of Suffolk, husband to her cousin Lady Alice, is killed.

Indians appear at the time of contact, are involved in fighting or treaties, and then seem to vanish, usually onto reservations. In <i>Native Seattle</i>, Coll Thrush explodes the commonly accepted notion that Indians and cities-and thus Indian and urban histories-are mutually exclusive, that Indians and cities cannot coexist, and that one must necessarily be eclipsed by the other. Native people and places played a vital part in the founding of Seattle and in what the city is today, just as urban changes transformed what it meant to be Native.</p><p>On the urban indigenous frontier of the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s, Indians were central to town life. Native Americans literally made Seattle possible through their labor and their participation, even as they were made scapegoats for urban disorder. As late as 1880, Seattle was still very much a Native place. Between the 1880s and the 1930s, however, Seattle's urban and Indian histories were transformed as the town turned into a metropolis. Massive changes in the urban environment dramatically affected indigenous people's abilities to survive in traditional places. The movement of Native people and their material culture to Seattle from all across the region inspired new identities both for the migrants and for the city itself. As boosters, historians, and pioneers tried to explain Seattle's historical trajectory, they told stories about Indians: as hostile enemies, as exotic Others, and as noble symbols of a vanished wilderness. But by the beginning of World War II, a new multitribal urban Native community had begun to take shape in Seattle, even as it was overshadowed by the city's appropriation of Indian images to understand and sell itself.</p><p>After World War II, more changes in the city, combined with the agency of Native people, led to a new visibility and authority for Indians in Seattle. The descendants of Seattle's indigenous peoples capitalized on broader historical revisionism to claim new authority over urban places and narratives. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, Native people have returned to the center of civic life, not as contrived symbols of a whitewashed past but on their own terms. </p><p>In Seattle, the strands of urban and Indian history have always been intertwined. Including an atlas of indigenous Seattle created with linguist Nile Thompson, <i>Native Seattle</i> is a new kind of urban Indian history, a book with implications that reach far beyond the region.</p><p><b>Coll Thrush</b> is assistant professor of history at the University of British Columbia.</p><p>"Coll Thrush quite brilliantly weaves together accounts of the lived experiences of Native peoples in Seattle with the very different ways in which those experiences came to be recorded in white folklore and place-names and in the environmental fabric of Seattle's cultural landscapes. The result is a tour de force." -- from the Foreword by William Cronon</p><p>"This is the best book, by far, that I have ever read about Indians and cities. Thrush's excavation and analysis are deep and wide-ranging, his narrative impassioned and engaging. A fantastic contribution." -- Ned Blackhawk, author of <i>Violence over the Land: Indians and Empires in the Early American West</i></p><p>"This book is a concerted effort to mobilize a new telling of history in order to reject what is essentially an ideological narrative of the past. Indian people, Thrush argues, were not simply part of the prehistory of the city, destined to give way before modernity. They were, in fact, active co-participants in its development. Well written and argued, this book forces readers to understand Seattle-and perhaps, by extension, other cities-in whole new ways." -- Philip Deloria, author of <i>Playing Indian</i> and <i>Indians in Unexpected Places</i></p><p></p></p><p><p>An exploration of Native people in Seattle from the city's founding to the present.</p>"<i>Native Seattle</i> is an interesting and lively history of Seattle with an unusual Native American focus, enhanced with many historic photos, copious notes, and a unique atlas of sites historically significant to tribes of the region. Strongly recommended for libraries in the Puget Sound region." - <i>Multicultural Review</i> <p> "[A] vivid new book . . . <i>Native Seattle</i> chronicles the breathtaking and traumatic pace of change Seattle's Native people have endured, and the resiliency with which they have regrouped and reconstituted themselves. . . . Its meticulous atlas describes the 'lost' places of the Indian landscape. But they're not really lost - they live today under the city's 21st-century skin." - <i>Seattle Times</i> </p><p> "Thrush shows just how important a role indigenous people s served in the economic and cultural growth of the city and region and he traces their history through the twentieth century to the present day . . . Of particular value . . . is the Atlas of Indigenous Seattle, which lists and locates the Salish names of dozens of geographic features. . . . Many land and water features have disappeared under concrete and asphalt, but <i>Native Seattle</i> keeps them alive. - HistoryLink.org</p></p><h2>The Adventures of Nanny Piggins (Nanny Piggins, 1)</h2><p><b>Three children and their hilariously subversive nanny pig embark on zany adventures in this award-winning middle grade debut illustrated by Caldecott winnter Dan Santat.<br></b><br>The three Green children are cared for by a nanny pig. Yes, a pig--a fabulously sassy and impeccably dressed pig, as a matter of fact! With her insatiable urge to eat chocolate (and feed chocolate to everyone she loves), her high-flying spirit, and her unending sense of fun, Nanny Piggins takes Derrick, Samantha, and Michael on a year of surprises, yummy treats, and adventures they'll never forget. <br><br>It's no surprise that Booklist proclaimed, "Mary Poppins, move over--or get shoved out of the way." Nanny Piggins is a refreshing and dynamic addition to favorite classic nannies: Amelia Bedelia, Mrs. Piggle Wiggle, and, of course, Mary Poppins. <br><br>Read more books in the series: <i>Nanny Piggins and the Wicked Plan</i> and <i>Nanny Piggins and the Runaway Lion</i>.<br></p><p>Rachel Spratt is a stand-up comedian and has been writing comedy for television for over ten years.

Most recently employed at the circus as the pig shot out of a cannon, she assumes the title Nanny when she spies a Help Wanted sign on the lawn of the Green family. Mrs. Green is dead, and Mr. Green is so tightfisted he refuses to pay a human nanny. So when a pig applies . . . . But as the three Green children soon realize, Nanny Piggins is a jewel. Extraordinarily clever, she knows when to morph that quality into deviousness, which certainly becomes necessary when dealing with the dull, pompous Mr. Green. The children&#x2014;Derrick, Samantha, and Michael&#x2014;promptly fall in love with Nanny Piggins because she lets them eat sweets all day and comes up with the most marvelous ideas, like taking a boat to China to get Chinese takeout. Even when things don&#x2019;t exactly work out as planned (and they rarely do), the high jinks and hilarity make them excellent adventures. Stuffing adjectives into this review is as easy as watching Nanny Piggins stuff pies into her mouth. This is smart, sly, funny, and marvelously illustrated with drawings that capture Nanny&#x2019;s sheer pigginess. Readers may worry that this first novel is so full of stories about Nanny Piggins there won&#x2019;t be enough left for sequels. Never fear. The last line of the book predicts Nanny will be stirring up more adventures, possibly even before breakfast.

She has worked as a public servant, a receptionist, in the horse industry, in local government, in publishing, in telecommunications, as a college lecturer, and she ran her own science fiction/fantasy/mystery bookshop. So far she's written six mainstream fantasy novels and two Stargate SG-1 tie-ins.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>As far as Ahsoka Tano was concerned, the only thing worse than being up to her armpits in battle droids was waiting to find out just how long it would be before she was up to her armpits in battle droids. She hated waiting. But it seemed that war was all about waiting-at least, when it wasn't about staring death in the face.<br><br>But I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not scared. I'm not...<br><br>&nbsp;With Resolute out of rotation for a refit, she stood on the bridge of Indomitable, one of the next generation of cruisers to come out of the Allanteen VI shipyards. Cruisers that were faster and more responsive than ever before, thanks to her Master's-what had the chief shipwright called it? Oh yes. Tinkering. Thanks to Anakin's tinkering, the new vessels were a definite cut above the first Republic Cruisers that had rolled out of production for service in this war against Dooku and his Separatist Alliance.<br><br>The differences had been noted, and were talked about whenever and wherever military types crossed paths-in battle, in briefings, sharing some chitchat and a drink in this mess or that one, or even the occasional civilian bar. The Jedi who fought on the front lines were talking about them, too. Everyone who relied on the massive Republic warships knew that their odds of survival had increased because Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker liked to muck about with machines-when he wasn't busy being the scourge of the Separatists Anakin.<br><br>That's how she thought of him now, after arduous months of fighting by his side, learning from him, saving him, and being saved by him. But she never called him that to his face. She couldn't. The idea of saying Anakin felt more disrespectful than a cheeky nickname. Skyguy was familiar but it wasn't...intimate.<br><br>&nbsp;First names were intimate. They implied equality. But she and her Master weren't equals. She suspected they never would be. She was pretty sure that no matter how hard she trained, how hard she tried, even after she'd passed the trials and been made a Jedi Knight, she would never come close to matching him as a Jedi.<br><br>How can I? He's the Chosen One. He can do things that aren't meant to be possible.<br><br>She snuck a sideways look at him, standing on the far side of Indomitable's bridge in hushed conversation with Master Kenobi and Admiral Yularen. Letting down her habitual guard the tiniest bit, she prepared to stretch out her senses. To feel what he was feeling behind his carefully constructed mask. It wasn't prying. She didn't pry. As a Padawan it was her job-no, her duty-to make sure her Master was well. To be constantly attuned to his mood so she could anticipate his needs and more perfectly serve him. Since joining Anakin on Christophsis she'd lost count of the times that keeping a close eye on him had made the difference between success and failure. Life and death. Young she might be, and still in training, but she could do that. She was good at that.<br><br>&nbsp;Besides, once assigned to this man she'd made her own private and personal vow quite apart from the public oaths she'd sworn in the Jedi Temple.<br><br>I will not be the Padawan who gets the Chosen One killed.<br><br>&nbsp;Around her, the bridge crew conducted its military business with brisk efficiency. No chatter, since the admiral was present. When Yularen was elsewhere his officers sometimes indulged in a little gossip, a few jokes, a smattering of idle wartime speculation. Nothing detrimental to discipline, nothing untoward, just harmless camaraderie to help while away the tedium of days, like this one, when battle was yet to be joined and the void beyond the transparisteel viewports remained empty of enemy ships and impending slaughter.<br><br>&nbsp;She could hear, humming in the background, all the baffling hardware that made these warships possible. Sensor sweeps and multiphasic duo-diode relays and cognizant crystal interfaces and quasi-sentient droid links and-and stuff. So much stuff, and it made no sense to her. The slippery info-laneways of computers she could work with, but she didn't possess any kind of knack for nuts-and-bolts-and-circuits machinery-constructing her own lightsaber had nearly given her a nosebleed. Anakin, on the other hand...<br><br>&nbsp;Machinery was meat and drink to Anakin. He loved it.<br><br>&nbsp;But she was letting herself become distracted, so she pushed those thoughts aside. Her immediate task was to ascertain what Anakin was feeling. That way she'd have a better idea of what to expect from him when the news they were waiting for at last came through...and an idea of how best to deal with him, once it did. Dealing with her Master's sometimes overpowering emotions was becoming more and more a part of her duties-and as the war dragged on, and their losses piled up, that job wasn't getting any easier.<br><br>&nbsp;He feels too much, too keenly. Maybe that's what happens when you've got the highest midi-chlorian count in Jedi history. Maybe that's the trade-off. You feel everything, so you're brilliant. You feel everything, and it hurts.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Not that his emotions got in the way. At least, he didn't think they did. And to be honest, she didn't, either. At least not as often as some people thought. Like Master Kenobi, for example, who chided his former Padawan for taking crazy risks, for pushing himself too hard, for letting things matter too much and losing his carefully measured Jedi distance.<br><br>She didn't always disagree. And sometimes, when Anakin had given her a really bad fright or when his mood became difficult, she wished she could chide him, too. But as a Padawan she had to find another way to let her Master know he'd gone too far. So she sassed him, or invented nicknames that were guaranteed to get under his skin. Sometimes she even deliberately flouted his wishes. Anything to break him free of sorrow or frustration or some bleak memory he refused to share. Anything to let him know, Hey, what you did then? That was stupid.<br><br>But mostly she kept her fears for him to herself, because all his bright and burning passion for justice, his reckless courage, his hunger for victory and his refusal to accept defeat-they were what made him Anakin. He wouldn't be Anakin without his feelings. She knew that, she accepted that, no matter what Temple teachings said about the Jedi and their emotions.<br><br>&nbsp;And even though he scolds, I think Master Kenobi accepts it, too. He only scolds because he cares.<br><br>So...what was her brilliant, sometimes volatile Master feeling now? Eyes drifted half closed, Ahsoka breathed out a soft sigh and let her growing Jedi awareness touch lightly upon him.<br><br>Impatience. Concern. Relief. Loneliness. Weariness. And grief, not yet healed.<br><br>&nbsp;Such a muddle of emotions. Such a weight on his shoulders. Months of brutal battle had left her drained and nearly numb, but it was worse for Anakin. He was a Jedi general with countless lives entrusted to his care, and every life damaged or lost he counted as a personal failure. For other people he found forgiveness; for himself there was none. For himself there was only anger at not meeting his own exacting standards.<br><br>&nbsp;Feeling helpless, she chewed at her lip. She didn't know what she could do to make anything better for him. She couldn't heal his grief for the clones who'd fallen under his command, or the civilians he'd been unable to save. She couldn't make him less tired, or order him home to Coruscant where his mood always lightened. She couldn't promise the war would end soon, with the Republic victorious.<br><br>&nbsp;At least he had Master Kenobi's company for a little while. She was sure that accounted for his relief. They cheered each other up, those two. No matter how dire the straits, Anakin and Master Kenobi always managed to find a joke, a laugh, some way to ease the tension and pressure of the moment. Between the two men lay absolute trust. Absolute faith. Now, they were equals. On the outside, looking in, she couldn't help feeling a little forlorn.<br><br>&nbsp;Will he ever feel that way about me? Will he ever believe in me the way he believes in Obi-Wan?<br><br>&nbsp;She opened her eyes to find Anakin looking at her. Though she'd tried so hard to be discreet, still he'd felt her sensing of him. She held her breath, expecting a reprimand. Anakin hated when she did this.<br><br>&nbsp;But no reprimand came. Instead her Master raised a tolerantly amused eyebrow at her...and in his eyes was a kind of tired appreciation. She felt herself shrug, a tiny twitch of one shoulder, and curved her lips into a small, rueful, I can't help it smile. &nbsp;He took a breath, he was going to say something-but then his head lifted. So did Master Kenobi's. A few moments later she felt it, too: a sharp, almost painful tingle of awareness. Something was coming. And a few moments after that, the comm officer straightened in her chair and pressed a finger to the transceiver plugged into her ear.<br><br>"Sir-"<br><br>&nbsp;Admiral Yularen, lean and predatory as ever, and alerted already by the Jedi on either side of him, practically leapt for the comm station. "Lieutenant Avrey?"<br><br>&nbsp;The slight, blond officer danced her fingers over the ship's comm panel, frowning, then gave a pleased nod. "Sir, I have an incoming message from the Jedi Council, Priority Alpha."<br><br>"Recorded or real-time?"<br><br>The lieutenant checked. "Recorded, sir. Sent by triple-coded multiple-routed shortburst." Priority Alpha. Skin prickling, senses jittering, Ahsoka held her breath. This was it. This was what they'd been waiting for as they dangled idly out here for hours in the middle of nowhere, an empty stretch of space on the border between the Expansion Region and the galactic Mid Rim, parsecs from anywhere remotely civilized. This is it.<br><br>&nbsp;Yularen's nod was swift and grim. "Very good, Lieutenant. Master Kenobi?"<br><br>"I think we'll take this one in the Battle Operations Room, Admiral," Master Kenobi said. His voice was mild, completely unperturbed, as though an Alpha transmission from the Council came along once or twice a day...instead of only as a last-resort emergency.<br><br>&nbsp;Ahsoka eyed him with unbecoming envy. One of these years I'm going to be as untwitchy as him. "Masters-"<br><br>"Yes, Padawan, we means you," said Anakin. "So what are you waiting for?"<br><br>She nearly said, An invitation. The smart remark was awfully tempting. He'd practically asked for it. But she held her tongue, because she was no longer that uncertain, mouthy Padawan who'd met her new Master in the midst of battle on Christophsis. She'd changed. Grown. Smart remarks at a time like this weren't funny. They were disruptive and unhelpful and they made her mentor look bad.<br><br>She'd learned that lesson from Clone Captain Rex.<br><br>"Lieutenant," said Admiral Yularen, sounding almost as calm as Master Kenobi. "Comm the captains of Pioneer and Coruscant Sky. Stand by for orders, battle alert."<br><br>"Yes, Admiral," said the comm officer. Color washed into her space-white face. All around the bridge the crew snapped to stricter attention. The scrubbed air tightened with a palpable anticipation.<br><br>Yularen flicked a tight smile at Anakin and Master Kenobi. "Lead the way, gentlemen."<br><br>&nbsp;With an effort Ahsoka smoothed her expression into uncaring blandness, hating that Anakin and Master Kenobi could sense her true feelings. As her Jedi superiors and the admiral swept past her she fell into step behind them, lightsaber bouncing lightly against her hip. Her mouth was dry-how annoying. She'd seen plenty of action since the start of the war; surely she should be bored by this now. But no. Her body betrayed her with a dry mouth and a racing heart, and sweat slicking the skin between her shoulder blades.<br><br>Soon we'll be fighting. And if I make a mistake I'll get Anakin killed.<br><br>&nbsp;"Ahsoka," said Anakin, not even looking over his shoulder. "How many times do I have to tell you? Our thoughts create our reality. Cut it out."<br><br>&nbsp;He always knew. "Sorry, Master."<br><br>&nbsp;It wasn't far from the bridge to the Battle Operations Room, just one short corridor and a single flight of stairs. As soon as they were ranged around the broad central holodisplay table, Admiral Yularen toggled his comm to the bridge.<br><br>"Patch it through, Lieutenant."<br><br>&nbsp;The holoimagers blinked on, bright blue-white light against the Battle Room's muted illumination. The air above the holodisplay shivered, mirage-like, and then an image flickered, partially disintegrated, flickered again, and finally coalesced into a recognizable form.<br><br>Master Yoda.<br><br>"Confirmation we have, Master Kenobi, of the initial report," said the Jedi Order's most respected Master. "Misled the Special Operations Brigade was not. A target have Dooku and Grievous made of Kothlis and its spynet facility. In Republic hands must they remain, for compromised the Mid Rim cannot be. Once the strength of the enemy you have determined, call for reinforcements you can if defeating Grievous without them is not possible. But contact the Council in real-time do not until Kothlis you have reached. Stealth and secrecy are our most potent weapons. Use them wisely. May the Force be with you."<br><br>Master Yoda's image winked out.<br><br>"Well," said Master Kenobi, breaking the tense silence. "This is going to be interesting."<br><br>&nbsp;Anakin frowned. "What reinforcements? Our people are scattered from one side of the Republic to the other."<br><br>&nbsp;"Coryx Moth is on patrol near Falleen, is she not? That's the closest<br><br>&nbsp;"One ship?" Anakin shook his head. "Obi-Wan-"<br><br>&nbsp;"It's better than nothing, Anakin."<br><br>&nbsp;Anakin didn't think so, if the look on his face was anything to go by. He scowled at Master Kenobi and Master Kenobi stared back, his expression unreadable.<br><br>"I'm sorry, but Master Yoda's message is too cryptic for my tastes," said Admiral Yularen. One narrow finger stroked his mustache, a sure sign he was uneasy. "Bitter experience has taught us we can't attack Grievous with anything less than overwhelming force. Not if we wish to finish him once and for all-and avoid a catastrophic level of loss on our side."<br><br>"And in an ideal galaxy we would have that overwhelming force at our disposal," said Master Kenobi, arms decisively folded. "Alas, Admiral, this galaxy of ours is far from ideal. And cryptic or not, we have our orders. Yoda's right-we must keep Kothlis out of Separatist hands."<br><br>"I know that," said Yularen curtly. "But the notion we can't call for support until we're in the thick of the fight? We all know that'll likely be too late."<br><br>&nbsp;"True," said Anakin, stirring out of somber thought. "But we'll have to live with it. In fact-" He shot the admiral a dark look. "I think we'll have to think twice about calling for help at all. Because if someone does come to our aid, it means somewhere else gets left undefended."<br><br>Yularen bristled. "What? You want me to risk this battle group-three cruisers-against-"<br><br>&nbsp;"I beat him with three cruisers last time," said Anakin, deceptively mild.<br><br>"I know!" Yularen retorted. "And that would be my point, General Skywalker. Grievous isn't stupid. He learns from his mistakes. He's going to make sure he has more than enough firepower to easily take us down! I'm not prepared to risk-"<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>The Road to Daybreak</h2><p>Henri Nouwen&#39;s intimate, inspiring diary of his first year in the L&#39;Arche community called Daybreak, where he now makes his home and practices his ministry.</p><p>&#39;s intimate, inspiring diary of his first year in the L&#39;Arche community called Daybreak, where he now makes his home and practices his ministry.Henri J.M.

For women of that era, however, it might represent an opportunity denied to them at home: freedom from a narrowly defined femininity, the chance to develop and exercise their intelligence, an escape from an abusive marriage or, occasionally, a career as a travel writer or political correspondent. As Dolan points out, however, these benefits came at some real cost, since Continental travel, even for the rich, was neither comfortable nor safe, and the woman who remained too long abroad risked condemnation at home as unpatriotic, unfeminine or unchaste. While some were decidedly the last, using a sojourn abroad to pursue an irregular sexual liaison or to conceal its results, many found in revolutionary Paris or benign Tuscany a personal and intellectual liberty impossible in England and, like Mary Wollstonecraft, wrote home to say so. Although this book is richly detailed and immensely entertaining, it is a bit of a grab-bag in which women of no particular interest jostle for space with the genuinely significant. Still, it is hard to forget the otherwise obscure Elizabeth Webster, reluctant repatriate, being borne backwards over the Alps so that she would not lose sight of her beloved Italy until the last possible moment. 16 pages of color photos not seen by PW.

How do we understand the phenomena that shape our experience? How do we make sense of our physical realities? Two guides&#x2014;a former member of New York City Ballet, Emily Coates, and a CERN particle physicist, Sarah Demers&#x2014;show us how their respective disciplines can help us to understand both the quotidian and the deepest questions about the universe. Requiring no previous knowledge of dance or physics, this introduction covers the fundamentals while revealing how a dialogue between art and science can enrich our appreciation of both. Readers will come away with a broad cultural knowledge of Newtonian to quantum mechanics and classical to contemporary dance. Including problem sets and choreographic exercises to solidify understanding, this book will be of interest to anyone curious about physics or dance.</p><p><b>Emily Coates</b> is associate professor in the theater studies program at Yale University, where she created the dance studies curriculum. <b>Sarah Demers</b> is Horace D.

In all the euphoria over German reunification, no one stopped to think what it would mean for Jana and her generation of East Germans. These were the kids of the seventies, who had grown up in the shadow of Communism with all its hokey comforts: the Young Pioneer youth groups, the cheerful Communist propaganda, and the comforting knowledge that they lived in a Germany unblemished by an ugly Nazi past and a callous capitalist future. <p> Suddenly everything was gone. East Germany disappeared, swallowed up by the West, and in its place was everything Jana and her friends had coveted for so long: designer clothes, pop CDs, Hollywood movies, supermarkets, magazines. They snapped up every possible Western product and mannerism. They changed the way they talked, the way they walked, what they read, where they went. They cut off from their parents. They took English lessons, and opened bank accounts. Fifteen years later, they all have the right haircuts and drive the right cars, but who are they? Where are they going? </p><p> In <i>After the Wall</i>, Jana Hensel tells the story of her confused generation of East Germans, who were forced to abandon their past and feel their way through a foreign landscape to an uncertain future. Now as they look back, they wonder whether the oppressive, yet comforting life of their childhood wasn't so bad after all.</p></p><p><b>Jana Hensel</b> was born in Leipzig, East Germany, in 1976. She is currently a freelance journalist living in Berlin. <i>After the Wall</i>, published in German under the title <i>Zonenkinder</i>, was a major bestseller in Germany. <b>Jefferson Chase</b> has previously translated <i>The Culture of Defeat</i> by Wolfgang Schivelbusch and <i>Death in Venice and Other Stories</i> by Thomas Mann. A journalist and writer, he lives in Berlin.Hensel was born in Leipzig, East Germany, in 1976 and was 13 when the Berlin Wall fell. This intriguing but frustrating memoir, a bestseller in Germany, portrays the disorientation of her generation, whose upbringing under communism ended abruptly with the integration of East and West Germany. Hensel rambles through a wide range of subjects: the erasure of memory; East German youth's alienation from their Western peers; her ambivalence about her childhood; their inability to adjust to the new world, which resulted in a role reversal in which Hensel had to "interpret" Western customs for her parents; and her generation's compulsion to disguise themselves as Western, changing their clothes and even their accents. But the disappearance of the artifacts of her childhood and the lack of value attributed by her Western friends to her memories leave Hensel at a loss. According to Clarke's note at the book's end, this was the first title to expose the experience of Hensel's generation. Although the memoir clearly struck a chord in Germany, it is so blurred by the "twilight zone" of Hensel's existence, "in which daily life seems arbitrary, provisional, and somewhat unreal," that Clarke's thoughts more clearly reveal East German history and Hensel's generation than the author does herself. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their curriculum includes tasting, cooking, and eating the harvest to establish a connection between the earth and daily life. This well-put-together book teaches even gardening novices how to do it, too. The book features colorful line drawings, photographs of the kids in action, delicious recipes that even five-year-olds can help prepare, and great little sidebars on subjects as diverse as &#34;Composting,&#34; &#34;How Flowers Drink,&#34; and how to hold a &#34;First Sprout Party.&#34;The difficulty of getting children raised in an urban environment to understand and appreciate where their food comes from presents a real challenge to teachers. The East Bay French-American School in Berkeley, California, has instituted a project to combine gardening and cooking into a learning experience for children ages 5 to 12. Students participate in planting, cultivating, harvesting, and cooking the produce of their school plots. Children are less likely to respond "Yuck!" when confronted with vegetables they have raised from seed themselves. The Brennans recount the school's success with this gardening program and catalog the most suitable plants for a children's school garden plot. A few simple recipes offer encouragement to parents with children who want to help out in the kitchen. The Brennans' work provides a useful resource for many sorts of school and library nature programs. <i>Mark Knoblauch</i></p><h2>Philosophy of Hegel a Systematic Exposition</h2><p>Will be shipped from US.

She now lives in Shelburn Falls, Massachusetts, with her husband and their pets, a dog and a cat.</p>Shaw's anything but sheepish sheep are on the move again--this time by hoof. As with their previous misadventures ( Sheep in a Jeep ; Sheep in a Shop ), everything is just dandy at the start of their latest caper: "Morning's here! It's warm and clear! / Sheep load up their hiking gear." With packs on backs, the frisky flock trots along happily until the inevitable snags occur: "Trees and bushes soon grow thicker. / Where's the trail? Sheep bicker." Ears begin to droop as the woolly creatures make their way through thorns, prickers, fog and bog, and then--horrors of horrors--"The compass sinks. They're in dismay. / How can they ever find their way?" Of course, the ever-resourceful sheep manage to do just that--despite a final drenching rainfall. Though the antics will bring on chuckles, this latest effort lacks the comic fullness and laugh-out-loud visuals found in the best of Shaw and Apple's collaborations. Still, the light verse is as snappy as ever, and Apple's art contains her trademark details--including the dapper sheep's millinery and their delightfully emotive facial expressions.

He explored Siberia, becoming the first American to do so, and was chosen to lead an expedition to find the source of the Nile. It was on this expedition, in 1789 in which Ledyard died in Cairo at age 38. John Ledyard was the original Lewis and Clark Expedition. In 1786 Thomas Jefferson sent him to explore the American West. He was the first white American to see the Northwest coast of America, Alaska and Hawaii, as well as the first to visit Siberia. He wrote the only known account of the death of Captain James Cook that blamed his death not on the Hawaiians but on Cook himself. William F.

It describes the great pagan religions of the orient, and tells how their religious thought and ceremonies permeated, altered, and revivified Roman paganism. In its course, the book provides a coverage of all the more important eastern religions of the time, from their first appearance in Rome, 204 B.C., when the great Mother of the Gods was first imported from Syria: The ecstatic cults of Phrygia and Syria; the worship of Cybele, the Magna Mater, Attis, Adonis; their orgies and mutilatory rites. The mysteries of Egypt; the worship of Serapis, Isis, Osiris, their closely hidden secret rites, redemption ceremonies. The dualism of Persia; the elevation of cosmic evil, to a full and equal partnership with the deity; the mysteries of Mithra. The worship of Hermes Trismegistos, and the documents ascribed to him; Sabazios, Ishtar, Astarte. The magic, thaumaturgy, judicial astrology of the ancient near east. The emotional and intellectual impact of the great civilized traditions of Egypt and Babylonia upon still barbarian Europe. Cumont&#39;s &#39;Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism&#39; is the best general picture, on an intermediate level, of this important moment in cultural history. It is also of great value in analyzing an era which shared certain cultural problems with our own time.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Franz-Val�ry-Marie Cumont (1868 &#x2013; 1947) was a Belgian archaeologist and historian, a philologist and student of epigraphy.

"The Clown Prince of Racing" hit MacDonald's sliding car broadside, setting off a second explosion that killed Sachs instantly. MacDonald, pulled from the wreckage, died two hours later. </p><p>After the track was cleared and the race restarted, it was legend A. J. Foyt who raced to a decisive, if hollow, victory.

He has worked as a public relations executive at Ford, Toyota, and Honda, through which he has attended races at virtually every major, and not so major, track in America. He lives in Palos Verdes, CA.</p><i>ONE</i> <br> <i>Indy '63</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>It was go time for Eddie Sachs. <br>For more than 400 miles he&#x2019;d chased Parnelli Jones and Jimmy Clark in vain as they pulled away from him and the other thirty cars in the 1963 Indianapolis 500. He&#x2019;d run as fast as he dared, clawing his way past A. J. Foyt, Rodger Ward, and Dan Gurney and into third place. Yet he was still far behind the flying duo of Jones and Clark. <br>Suddenly there was hope. Jones was slowing. His car was trailing a cloud of smoke, a sure sign it was leaking oil. Sachs could see the oil on the track, on the nose of his car, on his windscreen and goggles; he felt it pelting his face. He could smell it. Like sharks with blood in the water, Clark and Sachs began to close on Jones. <br>Arguing with officials near the start/finish line was Colin Chapman, owner of Clark&#x2019;s car, and J. C. Agajanian, the owner of Jones&#x2019;s car. Another official stood nearby, black flag in hand. They were the same officials who warned drivers and crews in the prerace meeting that any car leaking fluids would be black-flagged and forced off the track. <br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t believe me, just try me,&#x201d; chief steward Harlan Fengler had warned. <br>Earlier in the race he&#x2019;d done just that, flagging second-place runner Jim Hurtubise off the track when his car started leaking oil. Now Chapman pointed to the side of Jones&#x2019;s car and the auxiliary oil tank. There were oil streaks on the car and a visible crack in the middle of the tank. <br>&#x201c;You know what you&#x2019;ve said about oil leaking,&#x201d; Chapman yelled above the passing cars. &#x201c;Now what are you going to do about it?&#x201d; <br>It made for quite a scene, the dapper Englishman with his pencil-thin mustache, white shirt, and tie, and Agajanian, a board member of the United States Auto Club (USAC), the sanctioning body of the 500, in his trademark white Stetson, cowboy boots, and Western-style jacket, both gesturing wildly. <br>Sachs added to the spectacle, wiping away the oil on his goggles with the sleeves of his uniform and waving so everyone could see his blackened arms as he passed the hubbub. <br>The officials continued to hesitate, however, and Sachs thought he knew why. While Clark was the defending Formula One World Champion, he also was a Scotsman and driving one of the new European &#x201c;funny cars,&#x201d; a Lotus-Ford with the engine behind the driver. No foreigner had won the 500 since 1920, and no foreigner had even led the race since then. Clark was also a rookie at Indianapolis, and no rookie had won since 1927. <br>Jones, a fan favorite, was driving Ol&#x2019; Calhoun, the same Offenhauser-powered front-engine roadster he&#x2019;d driven the previous two years and similar to the winning car in every Indy 500 since World War II. No rear-engine car had ever won the 500. More than fifty years of tradition were at stake, and if there was anything the Speedway stood for&#x2014;it was tradition. Sachs figured there was no way the officials were going to black-flag Jones and hand the victory to the foreign team. <br>If Sachs could somehow catch Clark and move into second place, though, those same officials might be willing to pull Jones off the track. Clark, who closed to within four seconds of Jones when the leak first became apparent, now seemed to be cruising, perhaps thinking that the oily track was too treacherous or that Jones would soon be black-flagged. Sachs was gaining on Clark. The huge crowd of more than 200,000 could see it, and they were cheering him on. The fans loved Eddie, and each lap they leaped to their feet as the yellow roadster approached, waving him forward. He could hear their roar over the roar of the engines. <br>It was a scene Sachs relished, and he was putting on a show, his arms flailing and sawing at the steering wheel through the turns as he moved closer and closer to Clark. His was the fastest car on the track, shooting down the straightaways and diving into the turns with the slightest of wiggles, on the edge of control. On the long straightaways he had a moment to think about his son, only a year old, his wife, and the rest of his family. He&#x2019;d promised them all he would retire the day he won the 500. He&#x2019;d led the race five straight years, coming oh-so-close to winning in &#x2019;61. Now it was within his grasp once more. There was no reason to settle for second; he wasn&#x2019;t contending for the season-long championship. Only winning the Indy 500 mattered. <br>Finally he caught Clark, sliding past going into the first turn, setting his sights on Jones. Could this be his year? <br>Just as fast, it was over. Perhaps it was the oil on the track. Maybe it was the &#x201c;marbles,&#x201d; the tiny bits of rubber that wear off tires during the course of the race and collect on the outside of the track. Or maybe he was just driving too hard. Most likely it was a combination of the three. Going faster into the first turn than he had all race, Sachs found his front tires suddenly sliding toward the outside wall. Then the rear tires were sliding and he was sideways. He fought to regain control, and for a moment he did, the tires gripping the pavement, before the car shot back across the track, glancing off the inside fence and bouncing to a stop. <br>Sachs convinced a safety crew member to give his car a push, and he drove back on the track. Any chance of winning was gone. There was a little vibration from one of the rear tires, but with fewer than twenty laps remaining, he decided to keep going. <br>Turned out it was more than just a vibration. The rear suspension was damaged, and after a couple more laps the left wheel separated from the car, sending him sliding again, toward the third-turn wall. He hit hard, the tire bouncing across the track. Sachs scrambled from the car and over the outside wall, waving to the cheering crowd. Then he slumped down to await the end of the race, mentally and physically exhausted, his dream of winning the 500 gone for another year. <br>On the track, Clark continued to slow. <br>&#x201c;I could see Parnelli up front and I could see that he was losing oil,&#x201d; Clark said. &#x201c;I really can&#x2019;t say if it was all from Parnelli or not, but even on the straights at 180, I could see lines of oil. I figured if I can actually see the oil on the track, he must be losing it something shocking. I suddenly went completely sideways and I was lucky to collect it again. Then, in the next turn, I saw Sachs do the same thing, only he wasn&#x2019;t so lucky. I said to myself, &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve come this far, it&#x2019;s bloody silly to pile into the wall in the last twenty laps.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>Roger McCluskey, who moved into third place replacing Sachs, refused to back off and took up the chase. He was trying to pass Jones and get back on the same lap as the race leader when he also spun and crashed. From there Jones nursed his car home to victory, Clark content with second. <br>As soon as Jones pulled into Victory Lane, the charges and accusations started. Shouting the loudest were Sachs and McCluskey. <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no doubt that I spun in Jones&#x2019;s oil,&#x201d; McCluskey said. &#x201c;I had to wipe my goggles every lap. He was just blowing it out. I don&#x2019;t blame the mechanic. I don&#x2019;t blame the owner. I blame the USAC officials. They are a very inefficient bunch. I&#x2019;m very bitter. They&#x2019;re not supposed to show partiality and they just don&#x2019;t do a good job of it.&#x201d; <br>After the race, Sachs retrieved his wayward tire and began rolling it back toward the pits, nearly a mile away. <br>It was the kind of move that endeared Eddie Sachs to the fans, and they responded with more cheers. Known as &#x201c;the Clown Prince of Racing,&#x201d; he loved playing to the crowd, often drawing the ire of other drivers who felt he was showboating. With his face oil-streaked and his uniform blackened with grime, Sachs rolled the tire around the track and back through the pits, waving to the delighted fans every step of the way, declining several ride offers from safety vehicles. <br>Sachs&#x2019;s mood changed when he reached his garage and reporters began to arrive, knowing he&#x2019;d have something quotable to say. He didn&#x2019;t disappoint. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the first time in Speedway history that the 500-mile race has a winner that does not deserve it,&#x201d; he charged. &#x201c;If it had been a fair race, a rookie, Jimmy Clark, would have won it.&#x201d; <br>Sachs pointed his finger at Agajanian, saying he received special treatment as a USAC board member. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t blame Parnelli, because he deserves the win. But I do blame the car owner. He&#x2019;s a poor sport. They black-flagged Hurtubise for the same thing. Those officials shouldn&#x2019;t use politics. Everyone should be treated alike.&#x201d; <br>Jones didn&#x2019;t deny losing oil, but he pointed out that when the oil level fell below the crack, the leak stopped. <br>&#x201c;I did put a little oil on the track,&#x201d; he admitted. &#x201c;However, most of the oil did not go on to the track. It went on my exhaust, and that&#x2019;s what caused the puff of smoke. There were several other cars out there throwing a lot of oil. I don&#x2019;t believe my car laid any more oil out on the track than anyone else. There was over a half tank of oil left in my car after the race.&#x201d; <br>Clark was diplomatic, posing for a congratulatory photo with Jones, saying the winner &#x201c;did a damn fine job.&#x201d; When he was asked why he lost, however, the frustration showed through. <br>&#x201c;Given an equal chance and a break or two,&#x201d; he said with a shrug, &#x201c;we should have lapped Parnelli.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>More than 2,000 miles away, in the Los Angeles suburb of El Monte, Dave MacDonald turned off the radio after listening to the 500. It was time to barbecue. For many in America, Memorial Day meant three things: remembering those who sacrificed for their country, listening to the Indy 500 on the radio, and barbecuing. <br>He&#x2019;d been pulling for Gurney, who was his occasional teammate driving Cobra Fords for Carroll Shelby, but was also happy with Jones&#x2019;s victory. Like MacDonald and Gurney, Jones was from Southern California, although MacDonald didn&#x2019;t know him well. Jones had spent his early racing days running jalopies on local dirt ovals, before moving on to midget and sprint cars on the national scene, and finally to the &#x201c;champ cars&#x201d; raced at Indianapolis. MacDonald started on local drag strips, before trying his hand at road racing, where he was beginning to make his mark nationally as one of the lead Cobra drivers. <br>He&#x2019;d been on a hot streak since joining the team at the start of the year, scoring the very first Cobra victory. He&#x2019;d raced at Daytona and Sebring for Shelby and won eight of his first twelve races. It was all a blur for MacDonald. At Daytona, Gurney held MacDonald&#x2019;s pit signboard. At Sebring, he shared a car with legendary stock car driver Fireball Roberts. <br>The hectic schedule also meant MacDonald was spending more and more time away from home, so he was enjoying his Memorial Day with the family. Racing had always been a family affair&#x2014;loading up the station wagon on Friday night and heading to a local track. Not anymore. He was hitting the big time. <br>They lived in a small house his parents added to the family property a few years earlier. MacDonald&#x2019;s six-year-old son, Richie, was racing up and down the driveway in a miniature replica of his old Corvette race car. Four-year-old Vicki was splashing in the small kiddie pool under the watchful eyes of his wife, Sherry. His mom and dad were there, and so was his younger brother, Doug, who dreamed of following in Dave&#x2019;s footsteps. <br>MacDonald was still a long ways from his dream of racing at Indianapolis, however. He was just back from Florida, where he&#x2019;d raced the week before in front of about 10,000 people on a racetrack marked by orange traffic cones and hay bales, laid out on an abandoned Pensacola naval airfield. In a race of Corvettes, Ferraris, and Cobras, he&#x2019;d been the first car to drop out, forced to watch Roger Penske lap the field on his way to victory. While Jones picked up nearly $150,000 for his Indianapolis victory, only the winner earned money in Pensacola; Penske pocketed $1,000 for his efforts. <br>Already a fan favorite in Southern California, MacDonald was building a legion of followers wherever he went. His aggressive driving style, the rear wheels hanging out and sliding through the corners, brought the fans to their feet wherever he raced. The professionals called it &#x201c;oversteer,&#x201d; and MacDonald was earning a reputation as &#x201c;the Master of Oversteer.&#x201d; <br>Others simply called him &#x201c;the Natural.&#x201d; <br>Shelby, a former race champion and not easy to impress, said MacDonald had &#x201c;more talent&#x2014;as far as sheer speed is concerned&#x2014;in a young driver than I ever hired. You can tell by looking at a race driver whether they have it or don&#x2019;t. He has the ability to go fast.&#x201d; <br>Back in Los Angeles, MacDonald listened with interest as the rear-engine Lotus-Fords of Clark and Gurney nearly surprised everyone by winning the 500. A rear-engine car owned by Mickey Thompson, another drag racer who until recently lived only a few miles away from the MacDonald home, also did well, finishing ninth. <br>MacDonald wondered if he would ever get his shot at Indianapolis. It was the dream of nearly every racer, and he was no different. There was a revolution happening at the Speedway, and he wanted to be part of it. New drivers and new cars were making their mark. He knew the Ford people were happy with his efforts in the Cobras, and with the company now starting to race at Indianapolis, maybe&#x2014;just maybe&#x2014;he might have a chance at the Speedway in a couple of years. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The charges and tension at the finish of the Indianapolis 500 carried over to the next day&#x2019;s luncheon honoring lap leaders. Sachs sat in the back of the room, cracking jokes and heckling Jones. Most of the older drivers had long since learned not to pay attention to the sometimes bombastic Sachs, but Jones was having a hard time ignoring him. So when Sachs approached him in the hotel bar afterward to offer his congratulations, the race winner wasn&#x2019;t interested. <br>Jones said he didn&#x2019;t like the things Sachs was telling reporters, especially that his team didn&#x2019;t deserve to win. Jones sarcastically asked Sachs how he knew it was Jones&#x2019;s oil he&#x2019;d spun in, since he&#x2019;d been so far behind the leader. <br>Then things got ugly. <br>Sachs called Jones a liar; he&#x2019;d been right behind him. Jones returned the favor, adding, &#x201c;Call me a liar again and I&#x2019;ll bust you right in the mouth.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a liar,&#x201d; Sachs said. &#x201c;Go ahead and try.&#x201d; <br>It was a one-punch fight, Jones knocking Sachs down and the two wrestling briefly before being separated. <br>Clark, standing nearby and amused by the happenings, was asked if he wanted a piece of the action. &#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; he said, throwing up his hands in mock surrender, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not a fighter.&#x201d; <br>With the media getting wind of the fisticuffs, Sachs&#x2019;s wife, Nance, worked fast, taking some of her mascara to blacken his eye for photos. Then she put a miniature black flag in his mouth, telling reporters, &#x201c;His mouth has been black-flagged.&#x201d; <br>Both Sachs and McCluskey boycotted the victory banquet that night. Noting Sachs&#x2019;s absence, Ward couldn&#x2019;t help taking his own jab. &#x201c;I see Eddie&#x2019;s not here tonight. I guess he&#x2019;s home taking boxing lessons.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Despite the controversial finish, officials were breathing a sigh of relief after the race. For the fifth straight year the race was run without a fatality. It was the longest stretch of time in Speedway history without a death in the race, and officials were hoping the drumbeat of some politicians and members of the media against auto racing was beginning to lessen. They even let Sachs off with a slap on the wrist for his criticism of officials, as he received only a $1,000 fine and one year&#x2019;s probation. <br>Not as easy to handle was the revolution taking place at the Speedway, featuring new...</p><h2>Pyramids (Young Scientist Concepts &amp; Projects)</h2><p>Discusses the different kinds of pyramids, their structure, construction, purposes, and creators</p><p>Grade 5-8 A description of the leading theories about the development, construction techniques employed, and assorted uses of Egyptian pyramids. The bulk of the text is made up of quotations from well-known researchers and Egyptologists, and sidebars featuring specific theories and evidence. The better part of two chapters puts forth some popular ideas about pyramidology, "pyramid power," and the possible alien origin of the structures, along with some of the evidence against such ideas. The index is finely detailed, and halftones and simple diagrams clarify textual descriptions. Lacking the large, colorful illustrations of Anne Millard's Pyramids (Kingfisher, 1996) and of Elizabeth Mann's The Great Pyramid (Mikaya, 1996), this title has less visual appeal than those volumes. Yet its information is sound, diverse, and well presented. In a class by itself is John D. Clare's Pyramids of Ancient Egypt (Harcourt, 1992). It uses large color photographs of costumed actors in realistic settings to make the daily lives of the pyramid builders vividly clear.

When the mandarins of Her Majesty's spanking new agency MicroGlobe One need somebody to goad cruise-line king Sir Max Tarn, fingered by his own accountant as a high-end arms dealer, into cutting and running so they can pull him in without giving away the accountant, the obvious choice is James Bond, who's just celebrated his promotion to Director of the Double Zero troubleshooting branch by foiling a hijacking on Sir Max's own ship. In go Bond and his inamorata Fredericka von Gr sse (Never Send Flowers, 1993), and out pop Sir Max and his wife--apparently right into a fatal auto accident. It's up to Bond, who actually saw Tarn pulling away from Hall's Manor hours after the supposed crash, to get the goods on the late Sir Max--a labor of hate that takes him from London to Seville to Jerusalem (for an unusually gratuitous episode with Tarn's wife) to Tarn's family estate of Wasserburg in Germany (where you'll never guess what Bond learns about Tarn's political affiliations) to San Juan, where Tarn's nefarious master plan finally becomes clear hours before a cheerfully noisy holocaust. As he dodges threats of ``fast, sudden death'' from ``the most evil man I have ever known'' (the testimonial of a Tarn confederate), Bond finds that his romantic relationship ``had begun to give him something that had never been present with any previous woman''-- not a good sign for anybody who remembers the fate of Tracy di Vicenzo. A feast of the predictable--from counterterrorist high-tech to the return of Felix Leiter--that's probably the best Bond since Win, Lose, or Die (1989).

But New Yorkers don't give it much attention. They leave their trash on the curb or drop it in a litter basket, and promptly forget about it. And why not? On a schedule so regular you could almost set your watch by it, someone always comes to take it away. </p><p>But <i>who</i>, exactly, is that someone? And why is he&#x2015;or she&#x2015;so unknown? </p><p>In <i>Picking Up</i>, the anthropologist Robin Nagle introduces us to the men and women of New York City's Department of Sanitation and makes clear why this small army of uniformed workers is the most important labor force on the streets. Seeking to understand every aspect of the Department's mission, Nagle accompanied crews on their routes, questioned supervisors and commissioners, and listened to story after story about blizzards, hazardous wastes, and the insults of everyday New Yorkers. But the more time she spent with the DSNY, the more Nagle realized that observing wasn't quite enough&#x2015;<i>so she joined the force herself</i>. Driving the hulking trucks, she obtained an insider's perspective on the complex kinships, arcane rules, and obscure lingo unique to the realm of sanitation workers. </p><p>Nagle chronicles New York City's four-hundred-year struggle with trash, and traces the city's waste-management efforts from a time when filth overwhelmed the streets to the far more rigorous practices of today, when the Big Apple is as clean as it's ever been. </p><p>Throughout, Nagle reveals the many unexpected ways in which sanitation workers stand between our seemingly well-ordered lives and the sea of refuse that would otherwise overwhelm us. In the process, she changes the way we understand cities&#x2015;and ourselves within them.</p></p><p><p>Robin Nagle has been anthropologist-in-residence at New York City's Department of Sanitation since 2006. She is a clinical associate professor of anthropology and urban studies at New York University, where she also directs the Draper Interdisciplinary Master's Program in Humanities and Social Thought.</p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;Garbage Faeries <br>&nbsp; <br> <br>It was a radiant autumn morning. Tree leaves and car windows sparkled. The garbage bags that filled the back of our collection truck shimmered as Ray Kurtz pulled the handles that activated the bawling hydraulics of the hopper blade. Eager to be useful, I leaned against the load so no errant pieces would fall out, then stepped aside while the blade moved down and pushed the pile into the truck&#x2019;s body. The machinery howled a note higher as it finished its cycle. <br>Kurtz was a loose-limbed blond who looked younger than his forty-eight years. He had a mullet, an easy smile, a gently self-deprecating sense of humor, and about eighteen years as a New York City sanitation worker&#x2014;or &#x201c;garbageman,&#x201d; in common parlance. His partner, who threw bags toward us from farther up the curb, was Sal Federici, a dark-haired fifty-something with more than twenty years on the job. Federici, tall and lean, was enigmatically quiet and a liberal smoker. Kurtz had been a few-packs-a-day man himself until the emphysema diagnosis.* <br>I was working behind a garbage truck so that I might better understand some of the human costs and labor requirements of waste. All of us create trash in great quantities, but it&#x2019;s a troubling category of stuff that we mostly ignore. We particularly ignore how much care and attention it requires from a large, well-organized workforce. What would life be like if the people responsible for managing the waste of contemporary society were not on the streets every day? What do their jobs entail? Why don&#x2019;t they get the kudos they deserve? These are urgent questions, and since I live in New York, I decided to look for answers among the men and women of the city&#x2019;s Department of Sanitation. The best way to learn about their work was to do it with them, a notion that eventually inspired me to get hired as a san worker, but I started my research by accompanying Sanitation crews in various parts of the city&#x2014;which is how I found myself behind the truck on that beautiful morning, marveling at the light and trying not to get in Kurtz&#x2019;s way. <br>Both Kurtz and Federici had spent their careers in a Sanitation district called Manhattan 7, and both had enough seniority to be regulars in section 1, the district&#x2019;s plum assignment. The 1 has a reputation for clean garbage. The bags don&#x2019;t often break and maggots are less common, even in summer&#x2019;s heat. <br>Every crew starts their shift with a long oaktag card, formally called the Daily Performance Record but more commonly known as the 350, on which their supervisor has written that day&#x2019;s route (pronounced like &#x201c;grout,&#x201d; not &#x201c;root&#x201d;).1 A route is figured in lines called ITSAs&#x2014;Individual Truck Shift Assignments&#x2014;that indicate the specific block and side of the street to be collected, and in what order. The south side of Eighty-Fourth Street from Broadway to Central Park West, a distance of three blocks, is three lines. This particular example would be written &#x201c;84, B&#x2019;Way&#x2013;CPW, s/s.&#x201d; If both sides were to be collected (abbreviated on a 350, logically enough, as b/s), it would constitute six lines.2 Kurtz was explaining some of these details while we worked. Federici just smiled, taking drags on his cigarette between bag flings. <br>Kurtz was the driver and Federici the loader, but both men tossed bags. That particular day, on a block of fastidiously restored brownstones near Central Park West, we were doing house-to-house.* We picked up the garbage left in front of one small building&#x2014;a town house or a modest apartment complex or a church, for example&#x2014;and then moved the truck forward a stoop or two to get the pile that waited in front of the next small building, and the next, and the next. The quiet morning streets had been our domain when we started at 6:00, but by about 7:30 more and more people with pressed clothes and closed faces were emerging from doorways and descending stoops. It felt odd that our day was already well under way while these sluggards were only now heading to work, but my colleagues didn&#x2019;t pay them much attention. The passersby paid us even less. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The workforce of Sanitation is surprisingly small. New York&#x2019;s 8.2 million residents are served by fewer than 10,000 Sanitation employees (9,216, to be precise: 7,383 uniformed personnel and 1,833 civilians), all of whom make it possible for the DSNY to carry out its three-part mandate.3 The first two parts involve picking up the garbage and figuring out where to put it. Sanitation makes sure that more than six thousand miles of streets are swept several times a week and that the city&#x2019;s eleven thousand tons of household trash and two thousand tons of household recycling are collected every day.4 Both these tasks are organized by the Department&#x2019;s Bureau of Cleaning and Collection. Most of the people who work in uniformed titles are assigned to BCC. Once the trash is off the streets, the Bureau of Waste Disposal has to put it somewhere. The problem occupies many fewer people than are required for cleaning and collection, but BWD accounts for a quarter of Sanitation&#x2019;s $1.35 billion budget.5 <br>Snow removal is the Department&#x2019;s third duty. Snow does not belong to any single bureau. The public might assume it&#x2019;s a concern only during the cold months, but everyone on the job, in every title and in every office and among all ranks, will tell you that the many tasks required in preparing for winter make snow a year-round focus. <br>Behind these organizational divisions stands an eclectic assortment of support personnel. Mechanics, lawyers, plumbers, architects, engineers, electricians, analysts, carpenters, and a host of others keep the physical and political machinery of the Department moving smoothly. <br>The Manhattan 7 garage serves the Upper West Side neighborhood, which is where I was working with Kurtz and Federici. It&#x2019;s one of the fifty-nine districts into which the Department divides itself across the city. Districts, or garages&#x2014;the words are interchangeable&#x2014;are managed through seven borough-based commands. (There are five boroughs in New York, but Sanitation splits Queens administratively into West and East, Brooklyn into North and South.) Manhattan has twelve districts, as does the Bronx; Brooklyn North and Brooklyn South have nine districts each; Queens East and Queens West have seven each, and Staten Island has three. <br>Every district is commanded by a superintendent who oversees a team of supervisors, also known informally by their older title of foremen. Supervisors directly manage the sanitation workers who drive the trucks, pick up the trash, and operate the mechanical brooms. Supervisors also serve as intermediaries between what happens on the street and what happens higher up the Department bureaucracy. Until 2011, their responsibilities were organized according to sections, the smaller units into which districts are divided. <br>Geography, staffing needs, and equipment allocations vary from one garage to the next. Manhattan 1, for example, is a small district of just three sections. M1 covers the Wall Street area, runs about 20 collection trucks and 15 recycling trucks a week, and hosts 55 workers, officers, and support staff across all shifts. A big district like Brooklyn South 18, by contrast, has seven sections, runs 150 collection and 66 recycling trucks every week, and has 168 workers. Queens East 13, so big that it&#x2019;s called the Ponderosa, covers eight sections out of two garage facilities. Each week, about 185 collection trucks, 72 recycling trucks, and 200 workers serve the neighborhoods of Laurelton, Rosedale, Bellerose, and Queens Village.6 <br>If truck allocations are the measure, Manhattan 7, which has five sections and runs about a hundred collection and fifty recycling trucks a week, is the borough&#x2019;s second busiest.7 Four of M7&#x2019;s five sections boast trendy shops, lace-curtain restaurants, and a surfeit of luxury residential real estate, which varies from well-kept single-family homes and block-square prewar palaces to big-box newcomers like Donald Trump&#x2019;s mammoth structures on a former rail yard overlooking the Hudson River. In the 5 section, the district&#x2019;s northernmost, Spanish is heard as often as English, and corner bodegas are more common than high-end retailers. It&#x2019;s easier to find small diners not famous for their coffee than cloth-napkin establishments requiring reservations. Columbia University, edging the top of the 5, inflects the streets with a college-town accent. Garbage in the 5 is supposedly heavier and messier than in the rest of the district and is alleged to attract more rats. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Kurtz, Federici, and I were making our way down a street lined with tall sycamore trees and elegant town houses when all at once, as if she had materialized out of the remarkable morning light, a muse appeared. She was tall, slender, in her mid-twenties, with flawless olive skin, large eyes, full lips. Her hair, neat behind her shoulders, bounced lightly in sync with her brisk footsteps. Surely, I thought, this was the inspiration for Richard Wilbur&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;Transit,&#x201d; which starts, &#x201c;A woman I have never seen before / Steps from the darkness of her town-house door / At just that crux of time when she is made / So beautiful that she or time must fade.&#x201d; <br>As we turned to watch her, time did fade. So did our focus on our work. <br>&#x201c;What use to claim that as she tugs her gloves / A phantom heraldry of all the loves / Blares from the lintel? That the staggered sun / Forgets, in his confusion, how to run?&#x201d;8 <br>Never mind the sun&#x2014;Kurtz was the one who was staggered. He leaned against the truck, folded his arms, and gazed at her; when a trace of her perfume reached us, he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. I imagined tendrils of fragrance curling cartoon-style around his chin, tickling his nose with a long feminine finger. He smiled hugely, his eyes still closed, and I smiled as well to see a man so frankly enjoy the sight, and scent, of a woman. <br>I didn&#x2019;t know it yet, but that morning on the street I was also observing a man who could stare so blatantly because any potentially disapproving members of the public wouldn&#x2019;t notice him doing it. In fact, as Kurtz knew well, passersby didn&#x2019;t even see him. Years on the job had taught him that when he put on his uniform every morning, like Federici and every other sanitation worker in the city, he became invisible. <br>In mechanical brooms or driving the truck, san workers are merely obstacles to be skirted. When I worked parade cleanups in warm weather, I quickly learned that it was useless to ask bystanders who lingered against the barricades to move back just a little. The coarse bristles of my hand broom were going to scrape their sandaled feet, but even when I stood directly in front of them saying &#x201c;Excuse me&#x201d; over and over, they didn&#x2019;t see or hear me. It&#x2019;s not that they were ignoring me: I was never part of their awareness in the first place. <br>Uniforms in general change the way any worker is perceived. The man or woman wearing a uniform becomes the Police Officer or the Firefighter, the Soldier, the Doctor, the Chef. Individuality is subsumed by the role that the clothing implies.9 But the sanitation worker is more than just subsumed by a role. Because of the mundane, constant, and largely successful nature of his work, his uniform (its official color is spruce) acts as a cloaking device. It erases him. He doesn&#x2019;t carry guns or axes, no one begs for him in a 911 call, he is not expected to step into a crisis, to soothe an emergency, to rescue innocents.10 Instead, his truck and his muscle punctuate the rhythms of a neighborhood at such regular intervals that he becomes a kind of informal timepiece. <br>Effective garbage collection and street cleaning are primary necessities if urban dwellers are to be safe from the pernicious effects of their own detritus. When garbage lingers too long on the streets, vermin thrive, disease spreads, and city life becomes dangerous in ways not common in the developed world for more than a century. It is thus an especially puzzling irony that the first line of defense in any city&#x2019;s ability to ensure the basic health and well-being of its citizenry is so persistently unseen, but the problem is hardly unique to New York. <br>John Coleman, president of Haverford College in the early 1970s, spent part of a sabbatical working for two weeks as a &#x201c;garbageman&#x201d; near Washington, D.C. His route took him to a tony suburban neighborhood late on a Saturday morning.11 &#x201c;I thought this might mean more talk back and forth as I made the rounds today,&#x201d; he mused. &#x201c;While I wouldn&#x2019;t have time to talk at length, there was time to exchange the greetings that go with civilized ways. This was where I got my shock.&#x201d; <br>Both men and women gave me the silent or staring treatment. A woman in housecoat and curlers putting her last tidbit of slops into the pail was startled as I came around the corner of her house. At the sound of my greeting, she gathered her housecoat tightly about her and moved quickly indoors. I heard the lock click&nbsp;&#x2026; Another woman had a strange, large animal, more like a vicu�a than anything else, in her yard. I asked her what kind of dog it was. She gaped at me. I thought she was hard of hearing and asked my question louder. There was a touch of a shudder before she turned coldly away. A man playing ball with his two young sons looked over in response to my voice, stared without a change of face, and then calmly threw the next ball to one of the boys. And so it went in almost every yard.12 <br>No wonder people gaped at him or turned away. By speaking to the householders he met on his route, Coleman had transgressed. Invisible laborers are not supposed to make themselves noticed. They are meant to do their work and move along, heads down and mouths shut. Though most householders would admit, if pressed, that the people who tote away their garbage are important in the larger scheme of things, it doesn&#x2019;t mean they must acknowledge the one who does the toting. Heaven forfend! <br>Here&#x2019;s an especially illuminating and depressingly common example of Invisibility Syndrome, one I&#x2019;ve heard from junior Sanitation folk and seasoned vets alike. A san man reaching to pick up a bag of trash encounters a dog walker who lets Fido let loose at that exact instant on that exact bag. Imagine the san man in motion, his body bent so he can grasp the slick plastic of the bag, finding himself face-to-face with a dog&#x2019;s raised leg and liquid output. A variation on this theme is that the dog walker plops a sample of the pooch&#x2019;s poop precisely where the worker is reaching, in which case the worker in motion closes his fist not around the ear of the bag but around a bagged (or sometimes unbagged) pile of shit. <br>The situation presents a few choices. The worker can ignore it. Or he can politely but firmly point out to the dog walker that her behavior is offensive. Or he can become irate. A new hire still on probation is wise to stay quiet, though he in particular will often find that the most difficult choice. A san worker with a few years on the job who is familiar with this moment knows that nothing he does or says will change the dog walker&#x2019;s attitude or behavior&#x2014;in fact, even a polite comment from him will most likely inspire invective&#x2014;so he usually doesn&#x2019;t bother to respond. <br>But to another man with a few years on the job, or perhaps the same man on a different day, the rudeness can carry an unexpected prickle, maybe even a sting, that ruptures his calm. In the versions I&#x2019;ve heard, the san man who decides to protest always starts by speaking respectfully, which may or may not be true, and the dog walker always responds with obscenities, which I believe. The curses are variations on the command that the san man mind his...</p><h2>Joel Meyerowitz</h2><p>This monograph forms an introduction to the major themes and the key images of American photographer Joel Meyerowitz, illustrated with 55 chronologically-presented images that offer a fresh insight into his career.An introductory essay by Colin Westerbeck discusses Meyerowitz&#39;s life and work and places him both in the context of his time and within the history of photography. Born in 1938 in New York City, Meyerowitz went to Ohio to study painting and medical drawing at the State University but moved back to New York to work in advertising as an art director-designer. He then started to take photographs, leaving his job to concentrate on his new career. Shooting film in black-and-white, he travelled around the United States for three months after which he was offered a Guggenheim Scholarship to take pictures on the theme of &#39;leisure time&#39;. It is as an early advocate of colour photography that Meyerowitz has had the greatest influence, for he was instrumental in changing the attitude toward the use of colour from one of resistance to nearly universal acceptance.His subject matter evolved from incidents on city streets shot with a small 35 mm camera to the large format field photograph. Architecture, light and space - particularly at Cape Cod - acquired a new interest for him. After the destruction of the World Trade Center in New York, he was the only photographer granted unimpeded access to Ground Zero where he systematically documented the work of demolition and excavation, rescue and recovery. He has been awarded the title Photographer of the Year by the Friends of Photography, San Francisco. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, both in New York and he has been exhibited and published worldwide, for many years.</p><p>Colin Westerbeck is Curator of Photography at The Art Institute of Chicago and an award-winning critic and writer.

What started as a simple interview for Holiday magazine quickly grew into an animated conversation that lasted nearly a week as Palge and Fox moved from bar to club to restaurant to auto repair shop and from one topic to the next. Fox describes, with amazement, the reception the legendary baseball player received at Gates&#39; Place, a famous barbecue restaurant, and The Flamingo, a big dance club. Over the course of the week, Palge shared stories about his start in the Negro leagues, his time with the Kansas City Monarchs, and barnstorming around the country, sleeping on the ground because there were no hotels for blacks. He also tells of his breakthrough to the big leagues when he signed with the Cleveland Indians and later pitched two shutouts against the Chicago White Sox. In addition to his baseball career, Palge tells Fox about his childhood in Mobile, Alabama, catching fish during the Jubilee, throwing rocks at white boys, hustling bags at the train station, and working in the Depression era medicine shows. connections with film and music celebrities like Orson Welles, Jelly Roll Morton, Billie Holliday, and Cab Calloway. He also expounds on his friendships with other sports greats, including Goose Tatum, Meadowlark Lemon, and Sugar Ray Robinson. The Ironic intersections between oppression and fame, and between poverty and wealth, that emerge from Palge&#39;s narrative memoir exemplify the affliction of talent and genius in an era of racial discrimination and segregation.</p><p>Captures the sometimes outrageous, often humorous, and always bigger-than-life spirit of the World&#39;s Greatest Pitcher, Leroy Satchel Paige. &#34;This is the stuff of dreams--overhearing a lively conversation between two voluble Southern originals. . . .

It was also an era of genocide. It was an era of media expansion. And it was an era in which the media lied. We moved from newspapers with circulations of a million in 1900 to the rollout of 600 radio stations in 1922, of television in the 1950s, and of the Internet and the World Wide Web when the century ended. But we inched no further toward the truth. Mass murders in the Soviet Union took an estimated 40 million lives in the 20th Century. Mass killings in Mao's China took another 40 million. Between 1963 and 1999 over a million died in the ongoing battles between Central Africa's Hutus and Tutsis. Between 1975 and 1979, 1.5 million lost their lives in the killing fields of Cambodia. Yet none of these crimes against humanity made headlines until it was far too late. Similar savageries are taking place today, but once again we are all too blind. Sometimes the reason has been media ignorance or indifference. Sometimes it's been press enthusiasm for the "ideals" of the killers, or, worse, sheer cowardice. In the 1930s, Geoffrey Dawson, editor of the Times of London, was less disturbed by the atrocities unfolding in Germany than he was by the idea of offending the Nazis. He wrote to a friend, 'I simply cannot understand why they should be so much annoyed with The Times at this moment. I spend my nights in taking out anything which I think will hurt their susceptibilities, and in dropping in little things which are intended to soothe them.' William Randolph Hearst was no better. He ordered his German correspondent to stop sending stories he called 'incendiary.' If the media won't tell us what's truly important, then it's up to us to ferret out the facts for ourselves. You Are Being Lied To is a good place to start. <p>&#x2014;(Howard Bloom, author of the book's Keynote Address and author of "The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History")</p></p><h2>Three Adventure Novels (One in Thine Hand, The Alliance, Leverage Point)</h2><p>1) One In Thine Hand [1984] - Brad Kennison is a returned missionary and a Vietnam vet looking for direction in his life. He makes a journey to Israel in the summer of 1973, at the height of the uneasy days leading up to the Yom Kippur War. Accompanying him through the Holy Land is Miri Shadmi, a fiery Israeli committed to the political survival of her state and scornful of Americans - like Brad. With Miri as his reluctant guide, Brad feels the spiritual impact of the Garden of Gethsemane, relives the tragedies of the Holocaust at Yad Vashem, and visits Israel&#39;s monument to freedom, Masada. Along the way, the two battle about politics and religion and brave a run-in with Arab terrorists at a remote kibbutz. Rivalry soon gives way to romance, and both are forced to examine their commitment to faith, family and country; 2) The Alliance [2002] - It&#39;s 18 years after the nuclear holocaust and the end of civilization, as we know it. Survivors are being relocated to a new society known as the Alliance. It seems like a dream come true for many of the new citizens. Crime, as well as harmful emotions, such as anger and prejudice have been eliminated, because the Alliance has computerized control over it&#39;s citizens from a computer chip that has been implanted in everyone. Eric Lloyd discovers the Alliance&#39;s corrupt power structure and vows to destroy it. But can one person change the world?; and Leverage Point [1985] - For Mark Jeppson, a professor of Arabic, life has suddenly become dangerously complicated. He&#39;s hired by an arms dealer to help cinch a multi-million dollar deal with Saudi Arabia and he&#39;s pulled into a world of international politics, fast living and organized crime. Is the deal, the money and the knowledge of horrible crimes, worth the risk of losing his children and fianc�e? Mark is faced with a crisis of conscience. Can he survive long enough to save those he loves, close the deal and help convict the criminals without compromising his own integrity?</p><p></p><h2>Fully Alive: Lighten Up and Live - A Journey that Will Change Your LIfe</h2><p>St Ireneaus said, "The Glory of God is man fully alive.

This attractive book - a comprehensive account of painting in Venice from Bellini to Titian to Tintoretto - is an accessible introduction to the paintings of this period. Peter Humfrey surveys the development of a distinctly Venetian artistic tradition from the middle years of the fifteenth century to the end of the sixteenth century. He discusses the work of Jacopo and Giovanni Bellini, Giorgione, Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto as well as the paintings of those less well known - such as the three Vivarini, Cima, Carpaccio, Palma Vecchio, Lorenzo Lotto and Jacopo Bassano. Humfrey analyses these painters&#39; works in terms of their pictorial style, technique, subject matter, patronage and function. He also sets the art against the background of the political, social and religious conditions of Renaissance Venice, as outlined in his Introduction. The book includes an appendix that provides brief biographies of thirty-six of the most important painters active in Renaissance Venice.Peter Humfrey is Reader in the School of Art History at the University of St Andrews.</p><h2>Korean Children&#39;s Favorite Stories</h2><p><b>This colorfully illustrated multicultural Korean children's book presents Korean fairy tales and other folk stories&#x2014;providing insight into a vibrant literary culture.</b> <br><br><i>Korean Children's Favorite Stories</i> is a captivating collection of Korean folktales for children which are still being told, just as they have been for generations.

At the time of its completion, General Phil Sheridan called it the most usccessful Indian campaign ever waged - and many of its incidents have become frontier legends. But until now, the whole extraordinary episode has never been chronicled in full, in all its intricate and amazing detail. James Haley has carefully analyzed the causes of Indian unrest centering around the great buffalo slaughter by white hunters from the north that threatened to destroy forever the whole foundation of Indian life. He describes the competing factions - within the Indian tribes, within the U.S. Army, and within the government bureaucracy - which shaped the course of events. And he outlines the battle strategies and engagements that made the Buffalo War such a curious blend of savagery, heroics, accidents, and confusion - on both sides of the fight. Mr. Haley&#39;s extensive research draws heavily on contemporary letters and reports, and his many new findings overturn a number of myths and prejudices which have grown up around the Red River uprising over the past one hundred years. The result is an exciting, authentic narrative filled with the colorful events and personalities of a crucial time in the history of the American frontier. Included are fifty-eight rare photographs of the Indian leaders, buffalo hunters, Army officers, and Indian agents who each played a part in the story of the Buffalo War.&#34;</p><p>JAMES L. HALEY is a professional writer living in Austin, Texas. His other non-fiction books include <i>Apaches; Texas: </i><i>An</i><i> Album of History</i>; and <i>Texas: From </i><i>Spindletop</i><i> through World War II</i>. Mr. Haley has also written three novels: <i>The Kings of </i><i>San Carlos</i><i>, </i><i>The</i><i> Lions of </i><i>Tsavo</i>, and Final <i>Refuge</i>.<p>The situation of the South Plains Indians in 1874 was the product of all, understood, even though that history had left them impoverished and materially wretched, dominated by another race of men whom they had been exposed for only a few decades, and gnawed by a horrible intuition that their entire social structure was doomed, and the days of their tribes, numbered.</p></p><h2>How to Make the Stock Market Make Money for You</h2><p>As an experienced market technician and author of the book "Technical Analysis Simplified," I can state with some authority that Ted Warren's method of technical analysis is "head and shoulders" (no pun intended) above 98% of the other books out there that attempt to teach this subject. I have read nearly every book imaginable on market analysis, and this book displays a profound understanding of market machinations I have only found in one or two other titles. One of the things that struck me in reading Warren's book is that someone who cut his teeth on Edwards &amp; Magee (the "bible" of technical analysis) would find himself having to unlearn much of what he was taught. Based on my experience, Ted's understanding of the markets was far superior to that of the anodyne Edwards &amp; Magee, and his technique is more accurate. While Ted's method isn't the most advanced or the most comprehensive of technical methods, it certainly is one of the most practical and proven ways of profiting in the markets that I have come across over the years. This book comes with my highest commendations. P.S. If you haven't learned to view the market--as Warren advocates--as a battle of "manipulators" vs. the uninformed investing public, you probably aren't cut out for trading in the markets, anyway, and should avoid them altogether.</p><p></p><h2>The Conservative&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>WARNING: This book may inform you, humor you, or enrage you. The Conservative&#39;s Handbook provides a conservative viewpoint on a wide range of issues: guns, global warming, drugs, partial birth abortion, education, political correctness, entrepreneurs, and the wisdom of Ronald Reagan. If, as some have said, conservatives are ruled by facts and liberals by emotions, one would be hard-pressed to find a better illustration of the aphorism than popular radio talk-show host Phil Valentine&#39;s The Conservative&#39;s Handbook: Defining the Right Position on Issues from A to Z. The Conservative&#39;s Handbook provides a conservative viewpoint on a wide range of issues and ideas: Guns Global warming Drugs Partial birth abortion Education Political correctness Entrepreneurs And the wisdom of Ronald Reagan. The knowledge Valentine imparts is more than just information - it&#39;s ammunition for conservatives when they are caught up in discussions with friends and arguments with those on the Left. Many arguments between liberals and conservatives degenerate into name-calling and unsubstantiated claims. The Conservative&#39;s Handbook distills those raw emotions and extraneous thoughts into a cohesive argument for conservative principles and values, covering the full array of today&#39;s fiscal and social issues in a manner that is comprehensive without being overwhelming.</p><p></p><h2>Oregon River Map &amp; Fishing Guide</h2><p>Finally, the ultimate book for Washington anglers!

Arming participants with cameras and basic technical instructions, Ommer asked them to photograph themselves in any way they pleased?liberated, so to speak, from the voyeuristic eye of the photographer. Some chose to use mirrors as they captured their portraits, while others braved the camera without the help of their reflections. While many subjects required no intervention by Ommer, for others he acted as ?ghost photographer, ? helping them with the lighting and setup; in both cases, the models were free to indulge their inspirations in any ways they pleased?from sexy and provocative to romantic to simply being themselves. The cast of self-portraitists includes a wide range of personalities, from students to artists, actors, stylists, dancers, models, musicians, teachers, and more. This highly original book gives us a rare glimpse at the way everyday women see themselves?or wish they did.</p><p>Uwe Ommer became fascinated with photography at a young age and in 1962 moved to Paris, where he initially worked as a photographer&#39;s assistant. Within a few years, he opened his own photography studio, primarily shooting fashion and advertising photos. Quickly gaining respect for his work in Paris, Ommer began showing in local galleries and eventually published his first book, Photoedition Uwe Ommer, in 1979, a collection of personal and advertising works. In the following years, he would publish five more books of his photographs. In 2002, Uwe Ommer was awarded an Honorary Fellowship to the Royal Photographic Society for the impact of his lifetime of work.

He is also the author of many works of literary criticism, including <b>The Art of Fiction</b> and <b>Consciousness and the Novel</b>.In British writer Lodge's (<i>Author, Author</i>) modest 13th fictional effort, an elderly man's hearing loss embroils him in a sticky situation with a beautiful, manipulative young woman. Sexagenarian Desmond Bates wears a hearing aid after being diagnosed some 20 years earlier with acquired deafness and consistently misinterprets people's words (which Lodge milks to maximum comic effect). Bates longs for activities after his retirement from teaching applied linguistics, other than contemplating e-mail spam about erectile dysfunction and watching his wife, Winifred, enjoy her success as an interior designer. The novel takes the form of his newly begun daily diary. At a gallery event, Bates mistakenly agrees to help shapely, enigmatic American student Alex Loom with her Ph.D. thesis on suicide notes. It quickly becomes clear that Loom's intentions are anything but academic and her instability shakes not only the sound foundations of Bates's family life but his long-since-stagnant fantasy life as well. Lodge's amiable, deliberate narrative tickles like a feather, but his frequent pauses for lengthy, expository grace notes may not appeal to every reader. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Terry Poyser and Bill Brown have done an outstanding job of research and have included an incredible amount of detail about the personnel, organization, and operations of the company, while integrating it into the narrative in a way that doesn't interfere, but enhances it. The quality of the photographs are first rate and compare with those of Mark Bando's fine works. Through the photographs you get to put faces with the names of the officers and men in the book. The maps are plentiful and well done. There is a fine balance of first person accounts woven into the narrative, which is particularly good considering that this was their first published work. I hope that historians and authors will use this book as a model and a template for similar books. The only negative thing I can find about this book is the tag line of the title, The Battling Flank of the Band of Brothers.

Jack Tannous argues that key to understanding these dramatic religious transformations are ordinary religious believers, often called &#x201c;the simple&#x201d; in late antique and medieval sources. Largely agrarian and illiterate, these Christians outnumbered Muslims well into the era of the Crusades, and yet they have typically been invisible in our understanding of the Middle East&#x2019;s history.</p><p>What did it mean for Christian communities to break apart over theological disagreements that most people could not understand? How does our view of the rise of Islam change if we take seriously the fact that Muslims remained a demographic minority for much of the Middle Ages? In addressing these and other questions, Tannous provides a sweeping reinterpretation of the religious history of the medieval Middle East.</p><p>This provocative book draws on a wealth of Greek, Syriac, and Arabic sources to recast these conquered lands as largely Christian ones whose growing Muslim populations are properly understood as converting away from and in competition with the non-Muslim communities around them.</p></p><p><b>Jack Tannous</b> is assistant professor of history at Princeton University.&#x201c;<i>The Making of the Medieval Middle East</i> is no less than a marvelous achievement&#x2015;there isn&#x2019;t a stone Tannous has left unturned in his path of inquiry.

In this new biography Lance Parkin, author of Aurum's acclaimed <i>Magic Words: The Extraordinary Life of Alan Moore</i>, will go in search of the show's creator, Gene Roddenberry.</b></p> <p>This book reveals how an undistinguished writer of cop shows set out to produce '<i>Hornblower</i> in space' and ended up with an optimistic, almost utopian view of humanity's future that has been watched and loved by hundreds of millions of people around the world.</p> <p>Along the way Lance will examine some of the great myths and turning points in the franchise's history, and Roddenberry's particular contribution to them. He will look at the truth in the view that the early <i>Star Trek</i> advanced a liberal, egalitarian and multi-racial agenda, chart the various attempts to resuscitate the show during it's wilderness years in the 1970s, explore Roddenberry's initial early involvement in the movies and spin-off <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i> (as well as his later estrangement from both), and shed light on the colourful personal life, self-mythologising and strange beliefs of a man who nonetheless gifted popular culture one if its most enduring narratives.</p></p><p>LANCE PARKIN is a British author, best known for writing fiction and reference books for television series, most notably Doctor Who.

He lives in the USA.</p><h2>Fresh Fruit &amp; Vintage Wine: The Ethics and Wisdom of the Aggada</h2><p>Aggada represents a uniquely important aspect of the Talmudic corpus. While legal sections of Talmud constitute the bedrock of Jewish life and religious practice, aggadic sections explore the rich world of Jewish ethics, psychology, wisdom, philosophy, and theology. Fresh Fruit and Vintage Wine: The Ethics and Wisdom of the Aggada opens a window into this world for scholar and layman alike. <br><br>Jewish tradition includes a great deal of excellent commentary on the psychologically astute stories and insightful ethical maxims of the Aggada. In Fresh Fruit and Vintage Wine, Rabbi Yitzchak Blau provides access to this commentary culled from the broad range of Jewish literature: Talmudic commentaries, works of Jewish philosophy, Hassidic homilies, biblical commentaries, and ethical tracts. Insights adapted from the finest examples of Western literature also aid the interpretative process. <br><br>Fresh Fruit &amp; Vintage Wine takes the enduring wisdom of ancient texts and expresses it with freshness and vitality. The volume speaks directly to religious issues: Jewish philosophy, prayer, festivals, character traits, halakhic observance, a balanced religious life, education, and modernity. The writing is lively, engaging the mind and elevating the soul, and the unfolding meaning is a profound and original experience of studying Torah.</p><p>Rabbi Yitzchak Blau has taught at the Yeshivah of Flatbush and Yeshivat Hamivtar, and written for the Yeshivat Har Etzion Virtual Beit Midrash. He currently serves as the Rosh Kollel at Yeshivat Shvilei Hatorah in Jerusalem. Rabbi Blau is on the editorial board of Tradition and publishes widely in journals of Jewish thought. He lives in Alon Shevut with his wife and four children."Even a cursory perusal of this work reveals that R. Blau has impressive breadth of knowledge in aggadot Hazal and Jewish thought, as well as the kind of sane, balanced outlook on life one hopes to see in an educator. It is not surprising, then, that Fresh Fruit and Vintage Wine succeeds in providing a comprehensive, wide-ranging survey of aggada-related commentary. The book also works as an engaging exposition of Modern Orthodox philosophy at its best, a tribute to the author's success as a teacher." --~ Simi Peters, Tradition<br><br>Although the title, Fresh Fruit and Vintage Wine suggests a cook book, this new anthology of ancient rabbinic wisdom, accompanied by an analysis from Rabbi Yitzchak Blau is actually a recipe for life. As Blau states in the preface to his book, the wisdom that matters most is the wisdom that teaches us how to live religiously and morally better lives . The texts he shares and the perspective which he brings to reading them do just that. Begining with a chapter on prayer one which doesn t shrink away from either the necessity of a prayer life, nor the challenges of cultivating a meaningful one, this book has something for everyone. And while anthologies always tell us the most about the anthologizer, what they believe and how they think, this collection brings together texts and topics which occupy the hearts and minds of all spiritual people.<br><br>Focusing on what is called Aggada, and generally thought of as inspiring non-legal stories in rabbinic literature, this book manages to celebrate narrative without giving up on the power of nomos normative practice. That s no small task for the follower of any tradition, and for that alone this work serves as a valuable model for appraching any beloved tradition.<br><br>What allows this to happen? Love. As Blau says at the end of his book, we can return to the texts we love almost endlessly . I thank the author for reminding us of that, and for inviting us to do so whether those texts are rabbinic aggadot, the words of the prophet Isaiah, or the poetry of Yeats.Read what you love, lovingly, and it will inspire you in a new way each day. --~ Brad Hirschfield, beliefnet.com<br><br>Appropriately, Yitzchak Blau derives the evocative title of his selection of the Talmud s Aggadic material, accompanied by summation s and analyses of a wide variety of commentaries, from Rabbinic gloss on a verse from Song of Songs. In his preface, the author notes that the reference to fruit and wine in Song of Songs 2:5 is associated in the Talmud with a contrast between Jewish law on the one hand, and passages appearing in the Oral Tradition devoted to attitudes, perspectives on life, anecdotes, Biblical interpretations, and philosophical insights on the other. Blau, basing himself upon a latter-day commentary, explains the title as well as his approach to the material by saying that whereas Jewish lawis traditionally approached as reflecting eternal truths that transcend particular times and places, like vintage wine, this is not the case with respect to Aggada, which in order to be understoodas relevant, must be given fresh, contemporary interpretations. The Aggadic passages along with their explanatory discussions are divided into fifteen chapters/themes, ranging from Prayers, Festivals, Learning, and Halachic Observance, to Character Traits, Jewish Philosophy, the Goal of Life, and Modernity. The discussions of the Aggadot are fairly concise and wide-ranging, including perspectives drawn from over thirty traditional Rabbinic sources, as welll as occasional secular references to the likes of Tennyson, Carlyle, and Mill. The author is not hesitant about adding his own opinions and experiences to the discussions, providing a decidedly present-day air to the Aggadic passages under consideration. Reflecting his considerable experience in Jewish education , many of Blau s personal comments are drawn from the world of pedagogy, which should prove of particular interest to fellow practitioners. The author notes that one of his aims is to encourage and demonstrate to those interested in Aggada how expanding the variety of sources used in one s research would be of great benefit, and I believe that he successfully achieves this goal. --~ Jewish Book Council</p><h2>Sicily-Salerno-Anzio: January 1943 - June 1944 (Vol 9 [ix] History of United States Naval Operations in World War II)</h2><p>The ninth volume in Admiral Morison&#39;s history takes up the story of American naval activities in the Mediterranean where Volume II left off, and covers three major amphibious operations-the invasion of Sicily, the capture of the Salerno beachhead, and the long Anzio beachhead struggle.

Plain and serious, a girl who loves books and learning, Kelsea bears little resemblance to her mother, the vain and frivolous Queen Elyssa. But though she may be inexperienced and sheltered, Kelsea is not defenseless: Around her neck hangs the Tearling sapphire, a jewel of immense magical power; and accompanying her is the Queen&#x2019;s Guard, a cadre of brave knights led by the enigmatic and dedicated Lazarus. Kelsea will need them all to survive a cabal of enemies who will use every weapon&#x2014;from crimson-caped assassins to the darkest blood magic&#x2014;to prevent her from wearing the crown.</p><p>Despite her royal blood, Kelsea feels like nothing so much as an insecure girl, a child called upon to lead a people and a kingdom about which she knows almost nothing. But what she discovers in the capital will change everything, confronting her with horrors she never imagined. An act of singular daring will throw Kelsea&#x2019;s kingdom into tumult, unleashing the vengeance of the tyrannical ruler of neighboring Mortmesne: the Red Queen, a sorceress possessed of the darkest magic. Now Kelsea will begin to discover whom among the servants, aristocracy, and her own guard she can trust.</p><p>But the quest to save her kingdom and meet her destiny has only just begun&#x2014;a wondrous journey of self-discovery and a trial by fire that will make her a legend . . . if she can survive.</p><p>This book will be a beautifully designed package with illustrated endpapers, a map of the Tearling, and a ribbon marker.</p></p><p><p>After the death of her mother, Queen Elyssa, young Kelsea Raleigh was raised in hiding, in the care of two devoted servants who pledged their lives to protect her. Long ago, Kelsea's forefathers sailed away from a decaying world to establish a new land free of modern technology. Three hundred years later, this feudal society has divided into three fearful nations who pay duties to a fourth: the powerful Mortmesne, ruled by the cunning Red Queen. Now, on Kelsea's nineteenth birthday, the tattered remnants of the Queen's Guard have appeared to escort the princess to the capital to ascend to her rightful place as the new Queen of the Tearling.</p><p>Though born of royal blood and in possession of the Tear sapphire, a jewel of immense power and magic, Kelsea has never felt more uncertain of her ability to rule. But the shocking evil she discovers in the heart of her realm will precipitate an act of immense daring, throwing the entire kingdom into turmoil&#x2014;and unleashing the Red Queen's vengeance. Riddled with mysteries, betrayals, and treacherous battles, Kelsea's journey is a trial by fire that will either forge a legend . . . or destroy her.</p><p>Erika Johansen grew up in the San Francisco Bay area.

Vladimir Nabokov was a near-penniless Russian exile seeking asylum in the States. Wilson became a mentor to Nabokov, introducing him to every editor of note, assigning him book reviews for<i> The New Republic,</i> engineering a Guggenheim Fellowship. Their intimate friendship blossomed over a shared interest in all things Russian, ruffled a bit by political disagreements. But then came the worldwide best-selling novel <i>Lolita,</i> and the tables were turned. Suddenly Nabokov was the big (and very rich) dog. The feud finally erupted in full when Nabokov published his hugely footnoted and virtually unreadable literal translation of Pushkin&#x2019;s famously untranslatable verse novel, <i>Eugene Onegin.</i> Wilson attacked his friend&#x2019;s translation with hammer and tongs in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>. Nabokov counterattacked. Back and forth the increasingly aggressive letters flew, until the narcissism of small differences reduced their friendship to ashes.<br><br>Alex Beam has fashioned this clash of literary titans into a delightful and irresistible book&#x2014;a comic contretemps of a very high order and a poignant demonstration of the fragility of even the deepest of friendships.<br><br><i>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout)</i></p><p><b>ALEX BEAM </b>has been a columnist for<i> The Boston Globe</i> since 1987. He previously served as the Moscow bureau chief for <i>Business Week.</i> He is the author of three works of nonfiction: <i>American Crucifixion, Gracefully Insane, </i>and <i>A Great Idea at the Time;</i> the latter two were <i>New York Times</i> Notable Books. Beam has also written for <i>The Atlantic, Slate, </i>and <i>Forbes/FYI.</i> He lives in Newton, Massachusetts.<b>Introduction</b><br>&nbsp;<br>I first learned of the friendship and subsequent feud between Edmund Wilson and Vladimir Nabokov only a few years ago. A friend of mine had been tracking down Alexander Pushkin&#x2019;s descendants&#x2014;there are a few&#x2014;and mentioned in passing that Wilson and Nabokov had ended a quarter-century-long friendship because of a disagreement over how to translate Pushkin&#x2019;s novel in verse <i>Eugene Onegin.</i> I burst out laughing. It was the silliest thing I had ever heard.<br>&nbsp;<br>I hadn&#x2019;t known about this famous contretemps because I was eleven years old in 1965, when Wilson trained his guns against his longtime comrade in letters&#x2014;&#x201d;a personal friend of Mr. Nabokov . . . an admirer of much of his work,&#x201d; as he introduced himself in a salvo of ill-will splattered across the pages of <i>The New York Review of Books.</i> I wasn&#x2019;t reading the <i>Review,</i> then in its third year of publication, and it certainly wasn&#x2019;t lying around my parents&#x2019; house. I was reading <i>Boys&#x2019; Life,</i> what the Russians would call the &#x201c;organ&#x201d; of the Boy Scouts of America. I think Vladimir Nabokov, he of the wondrous outdoorsy boyhood, would have approved.<br>&nbsp;<br>I know a thing or two about Russian language and literature&#x2014;my harshest readers will confirm that modest count&#x2014;but I had never read<i> Onegin, </i>and was familiar with only the highest peaks of Nabokov&#x2019;s astonishing range: <i>Lolita </i>and<i> Speak, Memory. </i>There was a time when college students with literary pretensions read Edmund Wilson, but it wasn&#x2019;t my time. When I graduated in 1975, Wilson had been dead for three years, with his literary renown and influence already in deep eclipse.<br>&nbsp;<br>Several years into this project, I laugh less now. Of course the pedantic exchanges between two eminent men of letters still ring silly&#x2014;is <i>pochuya, </i>which could mean &#x201c;sensing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;sniffing,&#x201d; a present or past gerund? (Good question!) Did Pushkin know English well enough to read Byron? (Maybe.) But the end of a friendship is always a loss. Especially a friendship so deeply and mutually celebratory as this one. &#x201c;Edmund was always in a state of joy when Vladimir appeared,&#x201d; Wilson&#x2019;s third wife, Mary McCarthy, recalled. &#x201c;They had an absolute ball together. He loved him.&#x201d;1 Their correspondence was legendary, full of rambunctious exchanges about literature, gossip, sex in taxicabs, sore gums, and very genuine emotions. &#x201c;You are one of the few people in the world whom I keenly miss when I do not see them,&#x201d; Nabokov wrote to Wilson eight years into their friendship.2<br>&nbsp;<br>And then, nothing.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like so many intimate relationships, this one bore the seeds of its own destruction. In one of his very first letters to his new acquaintance, Wilson scores Nabokov for his punning, which Wilson finds tiresome. But of course it is irrepressible, and will continue throughout his life. Nabokov&#x2019;s last major novel, <i>Ada</i>&#x2014;the title itself a pun, alluding to &#x201c;ardor,&#x201d; and to the Russian <i>ah, da </i>(oh, yes)&#x2014;mentions Mr. Eliot&#x2019;s famous poem, &#x201c;The Waistline&#x201d;; and so on, <i>ada infinitum. </i>In many ways the two men proved to be two entirely different and contradictory people, Wilson the erudite literalist and Nabokov the ludist, the fantasist, the trickster king. The opposites attracted, and then they didn&#x2019;t.<br>&nbsp;<br>When their friendship ended, much was made of the fact that Wilson never reviewed any of Nabokov&#x2019;s novels. Indeed Nabokov himself complained in a gift inscription to Wilson, &#x201c;Why do you never review my works?&#x201d; But it is very hard to imagine Wilson enjoying, say, <i>The Gift,</i> Nabokov&#x2019;s favorite of his own Russian novels. <i>The Gift</i> would have infuriated Wilson. It is simultaneously a work of literary criticism, a memoir of the Russian emigration in Germany, and a complicated gloss on Pushkin&#x2019;s <i>Onegin. The Gift</i> incorporates a novella-length, jocoserious &#x201c;biography&#x201d; of Nikolai Chernyshevsky, a sacred figure of nineteenth-century socialism whom Nabokov mercilessly lampoons.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is supremely Nabokovian; a novel, and not a novel. And it ends with a perfectly crafted <i>Onegin</i> stanza, Nabokov&#x2019;s knowing nod to his favorite Russian writer. That stanza appears on&#x2014;but I anticipate.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is equally hard to imagine Nabokov reading, savoring, or even understanding <i>Patriotic Gore,</i> Wilson&#x2019;s unsentimental, revisionist overview of the literature and the mythopoeia that animated the combatants in America&#x2019;s Civil War. Wilson spent more than ten years researching the book. It is difficult to envision Nabokov spending even ten minutes perusing its index. When Gore appeared in 1962, Nabokov had already ensconced himself in Switzerland, settled atop a pile of money from the fabulous sales of his novel <i>Lolita. </i>America, and Edmund Wilson, were only faintly visible in his rearview mirror.<br>&nbsp;<br>Let me make two quick points:<br>&nbsp;<br>Told from such a distance in time, this becomes a story of unequal combat. Nabokov is very much alive in his work, perhaps less on the night table than on the college syllabus, but nonetheless he remains known to millions. Not so Wilson. In the years leading up to his death in 1972, &#x201c;he was not much read,&#x201d; his friend Jason Epstein wrote in a heartfelt obituary. Once hailed as the &#x201c;dean of American letters,&#x201d; possessed of what the biographer Leon Edel called &#x201c;a certain Johnsonian celebrity,&#x201d; Wilson is largely unknown today. When I mentioned Wilson&#x2019;s name to a participant at a donors&#x2019; event at the Boston Public Library, his reply was: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s weird how he makes everything about ants.&#x201d; No, that is Edward O. Wilson, the Harvard professor and author of <i>The Ants, The Anthill, </i>and <i>Journey to the Ants. </i>Edmund Wilson was someone else entirely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Second: There seems to be an infectious tendency to &#x201c;go Nabokovian&#x201d; when writing about the late, great novelist. Andrew Field, Nabokov&#x2019;s first biographer, decided not to include an index with his biography, a complicated and annoying homage to his subject, who sometimes bent indexes to his own playful needs. When Wilson&#x2019;s biographer Jeffrey Meyers wrote about the Nabokov-Wilson feud, he couldn&#x2019;t resist the easily available pun &#x201c;when Pushkin came to shovekin.&#x201d;3 Douglas Hofstadter, the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <i>G�del, Escher, Bach,</i> who spent two years translating <i>Onegin</i> with great �lan, fell into pun-ditry himself, asserting his right to &#x201c;poetic lie-sense,&#x201d; and so on.<br>&nbsp;<br>I myself succumbed. It is futile to resist the lure of such pseudo-verbs as &#x201c;pedanitifies,&#x201d; or to ignore the temptation to tack footnote after footnote onto my explanation of <i>Onegin</i>&#x2019;s scintillating &#x201c;Pedal Digression.&#x201d; When I needed to cite an <i>Onegin</i> translation, I quoted from the late Walter Arndt&#x2019;s version, just because I knew that would irk the Nabokovian shade. Nabokov hated Arndt&#x2019;s<i> Onegin.</i> I call Vera Nabokov &#x201c;Vera Nabokova&#x201d; in part because that is how she signed her name, but also to fingernail-scratch the Elysian blackboard where the Master may currently be lecturing. He inveighed against the feminization of Russian family names, and insisted on teaching <i>Anna Karenin, </i>never <i>Anna Karenina.</i><br>&nbsp;<br>These are pure Nabokovian impulses. Literary confrontations were to be pursued in this life and the next. When revising his<i> Onegin </i>translation after Wilson&#x2019;s death, Nabokov urged his publisher to shake a leg: &#x201c;I would like to see my edition printed before confronting an irate Pushkin and a grinning E. Wilson beyond the cypress curtain.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>A feud unto death, and beyond. As we shall see, Wilson attacked Nabokov from beyond the grave, affording himself a satisfaction we cannot yet fully appreciate. In the five years that he outlived Wilson, Nabokov, too, tap-danced on his old rival&#x2019;s tombstone, in a manner unbecoming the international celebrity and self-proclaimed genius that he was. And then Nabokov&#x2019;s son, Dmitri&#x2014;but again, I anticipate.<br>&nbsp;<br>In a famous essay, Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote that &#x201c;friendship, like the immortality of the soul, is too good to be believed.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>In the case of Nabokov and Wilson, it was.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Women&#39;s Devotional New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs</h2><p>Whether you&#39;re a young mother, a grandmother, single or married, the NIV Women&#39;s Devotional New Testament is for you.

To ask what it can do is already to acknowledge that its capacities are not unlimited. This question is partly Spinozist: no-one knows what a body can do. It is partly Kantian: circumscribe philosophy's illusory power, the power of reason or the faculties, and do not extend its sufficiency in the shape of by way of another philosophy. It is also partly Marxist: how much of philosophy can be transformed through practice, how much of it can be withdrawn from its &#x201c;ideological&#x201d; use? And finally, it is also partly Wittgensteinian: how can one limit philosophical language through its proper use?</p><p>This introductory collection of writings by creative and subversive thinker Fran�ois Laruelle opens with an introduction based upon an in-depth interview that traces the abiding concerns of his prolific output.

He is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist; however some have questioned the scope of his contributions to mathematics and natural philosophy. He is best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which bears his name. Known as � the father of numbers� , Pythagoras made influential contributions to philosophy and religious teaching in the late 6th century BC. He was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom, and Pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on Plato. Unfortunately, very little is known about Pythagoras because none of his writings have survived.

Author Andrea Davis Pinkney's tone is that of a friendly, well-informed teacher, which is fine considering the purpose of the book. Ideas for daily Kwanzaa rituals abound. For example, on the fourth day, in honor of <i>ujamaa</i> (cooperative family economics), families can use the coins that they've saved over the year to buy a gift for the family "like a clock that chimes or a hallway mirror." Illustrator Brian Pinkney takes on the more colorful role of storyteller with his scratchboard drawings of a family in the midst of daily Kwanzaa activities and celebrations. Each domestic scene is framed in an earth-toned border of traditional African patterns--bridging the two continents page by page. The thoughtful details and human interactions in each drawing speak to the core meaning of the holiday, that of honoring one's family, community, and heritage.

By living these words, by opening a daily line of communication with the Great Ones, practitioners will immediately feel the love pour out upon them.</p></p><p>Mark Ventimiglia was ordained by the Universal Life Church in Modesto, California, and carries on its traditions from his home in East Alton, Illinois.</p><h2>Young Avengers 1: Style &gt; Substance</h2><p>Legacy isn't a dirty word...but it's an irrelevant one.

As a youthful Loki attempts to bring the team back together for unrevealed purposes, the reality-altering Wiccan casts a spell for his boyfriend that goes hideously awry. Now, the teammates must reunite to fend off their own deceased parents, plucked from various realities with violently prohibitive attitudes that would make any teen revolt. Centering on a gay teen-superhero couple, Wiccan and the shape-shifting Hulkling, the book gives each character an engaging personality or, at least, a fun agenda to play out. The story is tightly bound to established continuity, but it flies by, thanks to clever banter and lightning pacing. It also manages to set a creepy tone with its not-quite-right parents and relevant conflicts that teens will find satisfying. McKelvie turns in clean, polished pages with eye-popping character work and shows some real and very welcome imagination with action sequences.

Judy Blume was the first author to write candidly about a sexually active teen, and she&#39;s been defending teenagers&#39; rights to read about such subjects ever since. Here, Blume tells a convincing tale of first love--a love that seems strong and true enough to last forever. Katherine loves Michael so much, in fact, that she&#39;s willing to lose her virginity to him, and, as the months go by, it gets harder and harder for her to imagine living without him. However, something happens when they are separated for the summer: Katherine begins to have feelings for another guy. What does this mean about her love for Michael? What does this mean about love in general? What does &#34;forever&#34; mean, anyway?

With the city on the brink of starvation, it seems only theft on an unprecedented scale can free Krakandar from Mahkas's madness and tyranny... and destroy Hythria's web of secrets and lies.</p><p>Jennifer Fallon is the author of the bestselling Hythrun Chronicles, which began with the Demon Child Trilogy (<i>Medalon, Treason Keep, Harshini</i>). The Wolfblade Trilogy is set <i>before</i> the events of the Demon Child Trilogy, and follows the adventures of Damin Wolfblade's mother, Her Highness Marla Wolfblade of Hythria.&nbsp; Jennifer Fallon lives in Australia.Chapter One&nbsp;Kalan Hawksword had discovered a great deal about herself in the past few days. And a great deal about her friends and family, people she thought she knew almost as well as herself. She&#x2019;d learned her Uncle Mahkas had a capacity for cruelty that defied reason and that her brother, Damin, wasn&#x2019;t nearly as asinine as she&#x2019;d feared. She had learned her cousin Leila was capable of taking her own life out of despair, and that the coolest head in a crisis that she had ever encountered was Tejay Lionsclaw. She had learned Rorin Mariner&#x2019;s healing power had severe limits and that if you asked the gods for help, you&#x2019;d better be prepared for the consequences if they said yes.&nbsp;But mostly, she&#x2019;d learned nothing was ever as simple or straightforward as it seemed.&nbsp;Kalan glanced furtively along the narrow, crooked street before knocking on the door of the safe house. She wore a plain cloak over her silken gown to hide its obvious quality, but she suspected it meant little down here where the very air smelled of watchful suspicion. Although she&#x2019;d left her horse with its silver-trimmed tack and imported Medalonian saddle back at the stables of the Pickpocket&#x2019;s Retreat and walked the few streets to the safe house, strangers were noticed down here in the back streets of the Beggar&#x2019;s Quarter. The locals might not know who she was, but they were certain she didn&#x2019;t belong here.&nbsp;Fyora opened the door for her. Wiping her muddy feet on the coir mat, Kalan slipped into the small, unremarkable house as Fee closed and locked the door behind her. The court&#x2019;esa&#x2019;s face was grim as she pushed past Kalan and the narrow staircase into the dim main room with its barely adequate fire. Two narrow benches were lined up at right angles to the hearth and a rough wooden table with three stools was shoved against the wall on her right, but there was no sign of Starros. For a moment Kalan feared the worst. Before she could say anything, however, she heard something breaking in the other room and raised voices. Turning to Fyora, she raised her brow with a questioning look.&nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s not happy,&#x201d; Fee remarked unnecessarily.&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you be happy waking up to find the woman you love is dead and your friends have sold your soul to the God of Thieves?&#x201d;&nbsp;Fee shrugged. &#x201c;In Starros&#x2019;s place, I&#x2019;m not sure what I&#x2019;d be feeling right now.&#x201d;&nbsp;Fyora didn&#x2019;t seem all that interested in discussing it further. She left Kalan standing in the small front room, disappearing through another door near the staircase. The smell of something delicious cooking wafted in from the kitchen when she pushed open the door, and then faded again as it swung shut behind her. A few seconds later the door to the other room flew open and slammed against the wall, making the whole house shake. Starros stalked toward the front door, clearly planning to leave the house, but he stopped when he saw Kalan.&nbsp;&#x201c;Come to check on your handiwork, I suppose?&#x201d; he asked, his voice heavy with scorn. &#x201c;Take a good look, Kalan. You must be feeling very proud of yourself. See! Not a mark! Of course, I don&#x2019;t seem to own a soul any longer, but what the hell? Who needs a soul, anyway?&#x201d;&nbsp;He was right about his remarkable recovery. Three days ago they&#x2019;d brought him here on a stretcher on the very brink of death&#x2014;broken, bloodied and barely recognisable. The young man standing before her now was whole and unmarked, showing no sign of Mahkas&#x2019;s days of torture and beatings. But the cost had been prohibitive. It was obvious Starros was just beginning to understand that.&nbsp;Wrayan emerged from the other room behind him and stopped in the doorway, leaning against the frame, his arms crossed. He looked weary. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s no point getting angry at Kalan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not her fault.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You told Leila I was dead!&#x201d; Starros accused. &#x201c;She was your friend. How could you do that to her? To us?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry, Starros,&#x201d; Kalan replied, tears welling in her eyes. She didn&#x2019;t need Starros to remind her how much of the blame she carried for Leila&#x2019;s suicide. &#x201c;Mahkas made me . . .&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You should have let me die, too!&#x201d; he declared.&nbsp;&#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t!&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why not? Because I&#x2019;m so damned important to the royal house of Wolfblade? Or because none of you wanted the guilt of two innocent deaths on your hands?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;If I&#x2019;d realised bringing you back from the brink of death was going to turn you into an ungrateful halfwit,&#x201d; Wrayan remarked, still leaning against the door, &#x201c;I would&#x2019;ve left well enough alone.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Nobody asked you to bring me back, Wrayan!&#x201d; Starros pointed out furiously, turning on the thief.&nbsp;&#x201c;Actually, Damin Wolfblade asked me to bring you back,&#x201d; Wrayan corrected. &#x201c;You remember him, don&#x2019;t you? Big blond chap with the power of life and death over you, me and everyone else in the province? Oh, that&#x2019;s right . . . he&#x2019;s your best friend, too, as I recall.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;A friend would never have sold my soul to a god!&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Maybe that&#x2019;s something you should take up with Damin,&#x201d; Wrayan suggested. &#x201c;In the meantime, lay off Kalan. She&#x2019;s on your side, in case you&#x2019;ve forgotten.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Where is my friend, then?&#x201d; Starros demanded. &#x201c;Where is Damin?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;He left the city yesterday,&#x201d; Kalan explained. &#x201c;Heading for Elasapine.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Running away?&#x201d;&nbsp;Kalan shook her head, wondering how long Starros could sustain his rage. She&#x2019;d never seen him like this before. &#x201c;Hablet of Fardohnya is reportedly massing his troops behind the Sunrise Mountains for an invasion. Damin left with Adham and Rorin and Almodavar and two and a half thousand Raiders. They&#x2019;re heading to Byamor first, to collect Narvell and all the Elasapine troops Grandpa Charel will let him have, so they can hold Hablet off until Wrayan and I can get to Greenharbour to warn my mother.&#x201d;&nbsp;Starros took a deep breath, as if his rage needed fuel to sustain it and it was being starved because nobody would fight with him. &#x201c;So I was what? Just a passing aside? A footnote?&#x201d; He turned to Wrayan again. &#x201c;Did he ask you to put me back together again because he didn&#x2019;t have time to deal with me?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s surprisingly close to how it happened,&#x201d; Wrayan agreed.&nbsp;Starros&#x2019;s shoulders sagged suddenly. He sat down on the bench near the fire, putting his head in his hands for a time, and then looked up at them, his eyes filled with despair. &#x201c;Does he know what he&#x2019;s done to me?&#x201d;&nbsp;Wrayan shrugged. &#x201c;Probably not.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Does he care?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Probably not.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why did you do it?&#x201d; Starros asked Wrayan. He sounded more curious than angry now. &#x201c;And don&#x2019;t give me any of that he is my prince nonsense. You&#x2019;re a Harshini sorcerer and the head of your own guild. You don&#x2019;t have to take orders from anybody.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Two reasons,&#x201d; Wrayan replied, pushing off the doorframe. He crossed the room and took a seat opposite Starros on the other wooden bench. &#x201c;The first was simple patriotism.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Damin might be arrogant at times and rather arbitrary when he decides to throw his weight around, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean he isn&#x2019;t right, occasionally. He has a war to fight and it needs his undivided attention. His best friend on the brink of death is a distraction he didn&#x2019;t need. Now you&#x2019;re all better and Damin doesn&#x2019;t have to worry about you.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I never picked you for a raving patriot, Wrayan.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Which just shows how little you know me.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;What was the other reason?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Selfishness.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Selfishness?&#x201d;&nbsp;Wrayan smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been offering you a job in the Thieves&#x2019; Guild since you were fifteen, Starros. You&#x2019;re bright, well-educated and have a good head for politics and organisation. You kept knocking me back. Now you don&#x2019;t have a choice.&#x201d;&nbsp;Starros looked at him, shaking his head in bewilderment. &#x201c;You sold my soul to Dacendaran so you could recruit me into the Thieves&#x2019; Guild?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Not the most orthodox way of going about it, I&#x2019;ll admit. But it is effective.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;What if I don&#x2019;t want to be a thief?&#x201d;&nbsp;Wrayan shrugged. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t matter. You&#x2019;re a thief now, whether you want to be or not.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;And what of my former life? You know . . . the one I had a few days ago?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Your former life ceased the minute Mahkas found you and Leila together,&#x201d; Kalan reminded him gently. She sat beside him and put her hand on his shoulder, hoping to convey her sympathy. &#x201c;Even if she wasn&#x2019;t dead, there&#x2019;d be no going back. Not now.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;What happened to Mahkas?&#x201d;&nbsp;She hesitated for a moment, and then decided the only thing to do was tell him the truth. &#x201c;Damin tried to ventilate his windpipe with a battle gauntlet. Did a rather impressive job of it, too. Rorin healed what he could, but Mahkas is still bedridden and likely to be for a while yet. He can&#x2019;t speak in much more than a hoarse whisper. Xanda&#x2019;s taken over running the province while he&#x2019;s ill, but I&#x2019;m not sure what will happen when he recovers.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t Damin kill him?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Because he&#x2019;s not that stupid,&#x201d; Wrayan replied heartlessly.&nbsp;Starros glared at him. &#x201c;You think taking vengeance for Leila&#x2019;s death is stupid?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Taking vengeance for anything is stupid, Starros, when that vengeance is liable to do you as much harm as your enemy.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;So Mahkas is going to be allowed to get away with everything he&#x2019;s done?&#x201d; Starros asked bitterly. &#x201c;Is that what you&#x2019;re saying? And that I should just accept it?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m suggesting nothing of the kind.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Then what are you suggesting?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m suggesting, Starros, that you are now a thief. Your soul belongs to Dacendaran. If you&#x2019;re planning to get even with Mahkas Damaran, do it in such a way that you hurt Mahkas and honour your god.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;You think I should steal something from him?&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;No, Starros, I think you should steal everything from him.&#x201d;&nbsp;Starros looked at Wrayan, a little baffled by what the thief was telling him, but before he had a chance to question him further, Fee came in from the kitchen carrying a large pot. She dumped it on the small table and, after eyeing the three of them curiously, announced that lunch was ready.&nbsp;Kalan took Starros&#x2019;s hand and squeezed it, smiling at her foster-brother, hoping to let him know how much she empathised with his pain, but at that moment Starros wasn&#x2019;t thinking about pain, she suspected. The pain was too raw, his grief too overwhelming, for Starros to be thinking of anything other than revenge.&nbsp;Copyright � 2005 by Jennifer Fallon.

That is, we didn&#x2019;t see it for what it was. Massive unrest from Tunisia to Egypt to Libya rocked the Arab world and threw the globe into political crisis. Within days, an earthquake-tsunami-nuclear calamity of terrifying proportions shocked Japan and sent the world reeling once again, even as the globe&#x2019;s financial markets shuddered to sustain themselves while states and nations tottered on the brink of bankruptcy&#x2014;where many still linger.All of this, of course, we did notice. What we may have missed was that ancient predictions for this period of time called for exactly this: simultaneous environmental, political, and financial disasters. Were we seeing the beginning of "the end of history"&#x2014;and not picking up the signal?In his prescient new book The Storm Before The Calm, seven-time New York Times best-selling author Neale Donald Walsch offers a startling answer: yes. But Walsch also says there is nothing to fear, advancing an extraordinary explanation for what is happening even now all over the planet.Then&#x2014;and more important&#x2014;he provides a stunning prescription for healing our lives and our world through the answering of seven simple questions, inviting people everywhere to join in an earth-saving exchange at TheGlobalConversation.com.Compelling and perfectly timed, The Storm Before The Calm answers every question that is worth asking about December, 2012 and beyond.</p><p>With an early interest in religion and a deeply felt connection to spirituality, Neale Donald Walsch spent the majority of his life thriving professionally, yet searching for spiritual meaning before beginning his now-famous Conversation with God series. These books have been translated into 37 languages, touching millions and inspiring important changes in people&#x2019;s day-to-day lives.

Just before they were put to death, the Rosenbergs wrote a letter to their two sons saying they were &#x201c;secure in the knowledge that others would carry on after them.&#x201d; <br><br>The Rosenbergs left their young sons a legacy that was both a burden and a gift, as well as an aching emotional void.

This is the story of how he tried to balance a strong desire to live a normal life and raise a family with a growing need to create something useful out of his childhood nightmare. It is also a poignant account of how, at age forty-three, he finally found a way to honor his parents and be true to himself.<br></p><p>Robert Meeropol was six years old when his parents Ethel and Julius Rosenberg were executed for conspiracy to commit espionage in 1953. Though this was certainly a significant event in his life, it was not the single defining moment as one might assume. It is also not the central theme of his memoir, though it does play a strong supporting role. In fact, Meeropol has only vague memories of his parents. What he does remember are years spent in orphanages and foster homes before he and his brother were adopted by Abel and Anne Meeropol. While the event did cause some childhood trauma, he reflects that "I can't help feeling that I gained as much as I lost during those years." <i>An Execution in the Family</i> is hardly the work of a bitter man fuming at the establishment for the loss of his parents. Rather, it is the story of a thoughtful person and his struggle to find his purpose in the world. Reared on left-wing politics and social activism, he knew he wanted to help others, but he was unsure of the route to take, and his writes of his confusion and troubles with engaging frankness. <p> Part of his restlessness stemmed from his inability to come to terms with his past. Up into his early twenties, he never revealed who his biological parents were, even to his closest friends. Ultimately, however, events forced him to acknowledge his lineage and confront the facts, plunging him into his own in-depth investigation of the Rosenbergs' case. Eventually he was able to prove publicly that his parents' trial had been unfair and that critical testimony against them had been tainted. He also had to acknowledge that his parents' names would never be completely cleared. The process proved rewarding in many ways, notably because it served to reveal a greater purpose for him: In 1990 Meeropol started the Rosenberg Fund for Children to support children of political prisoners, beginning his life as an activist and offering him an opportunity to honor both his biological and adoptive parents in the process. "My parents&#x2019; resistance inspired a movement. That inspiration survived their execution," he writes. With this memoir, Meeropol hopes in turn to inspire others. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><p>"Inspirational . . . moving . . . engaging . . . should be required reading."<br>- Michael Moore</p><p>"A riveting and deeply moving human document, filled with the ache and longing of a son bereaved by history."<br>- Jonathan Kozol</p><p>"Heart-wrending, honest memoir . . . Meeropol's captivating memoir deserves a spot on American history bookshelves."<br>- <i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Touchingly sincere."<br>- <i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>"What is compelling about Robert Meeropol's poignant memoir is his utter honesty in examining the question of whether his parents were guilty of espionage. Yet, this extraordinary candor does not diminish his anger at the travesty of justice that deprived him of his mother and father. His story is a personal, anguished search for truth, even while it illuminates a tragic moment in the history of our country."<br>- Howard Zinn</p><p>"I was intrigued by this brilliantly honest memoir in which Robert Meeropol describes his struggle to honor his heritage as the son of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg while striving to create his own identity. He writes powerfully of his childhood years of self-muting, his adult years of self-searching. And he writes with a lawyer's acumen on the question of his parents' guilt or innocence of the crime for which they were executed."<br>- E. L.

The Huygens probe's seven-year voyage through space (past Venus, Earth and Jupiter) attached to the Cassini orbiter, its arrival at Saturn and three-week dormant coast to Saturn's moon, Titan, culminated in Huygens' hypersonic entry into Titan's atmosphere, 2.5-hour parachute descent, and continued operation for 72 minutes on the surface transmitting date back to Earth via the Cassini orbiter. Saturn has 62 confirmed orbiting moons, but Titan (which is larger than the planet Mercury) was chosen as a has two major components of Earth's atmosphere - nitrogen and oxygen - but the oxygen is was thought to be frozen as water ice within the body of the moon. If Titan received more sunlight, its atmosphere might well resemble that of a primitive Earth. The hope is that study of the data gathered about Titan will help us to understand how the Earth evolved, and possibly what led to the evolution of life.</p></p><p><p><b> Dr. Ralph Lorenz</b> is a planetary scientist on the Principal Professional Staff of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, MD, USA.

There are more than five hundred million copies of her books in print, published in over thirty-four countries.<br><br><br>"All right, night owls, it's coming up on midnight, and you're listening to KHIP. Get ready for five hits in a row. This is Cilla O'Roarke, and darling, I'm sending this one straight out to you."<br><br>Her voice was like hot whiskey, smooth and potent. Rich, throaty, touched with the barest whisper of the South, it might have been fashioned for the airwaves. Any man in Denver who was tuned in to her frequency would believe she was speaking only to him.<br><br>Cilla eased up on the pot on the mixer, sending the first of the five promised hits out to her listeners. Music slid into the booth. She could have pulled off her headphones and given herself three minutes and twenty-two seconds of silence. She preferred the sound. Her affection for music was only one of the reasons for her success in radio.<br><br>Her voice was a natural attribute. She'd talked herself into her first job&#x2014;at a low-frequency, low-budget station in rural Georgia&#x2014;with no experience, no r�sum� and a brand-new high school diploma. And she was perfectly aware that it was her voice that had landed her that position. That and her willingness to work for next to nothing, make coffee and double as the station's receptionist. Ten years later, her voice was hardly her only qualification. But it still often turned the tide.<br><br>She'd never found the time to pursue the degree in communications she still coveted. But she could double&#x2014;and had&#x2014;as engineer, newscaster, interviewer and program director. She had an encyclopedic memory for songs and recording artists, and a respect for both. Radio had been her home for a decade, and she loved it.<br><br>Her easygoing, flirtatious on-air personality was often at odds with the intense, organized and ambitious woman who rarely slept more than six hours and usually ate on the run. The public Cilla O'Roarke was a sexy radio princess who mingled with celebrities and had a job loaded with glamour and excitement. The private woman spent an average of ten hours a day at the station or on station business, was fiercely determined to put her younger sister through college and hadn't had a date in two years of Saturday nights.<br><br>And didn't want one.<br><br>Setting the headphones aside, she rechecked her daily log for her next fifteen-minute block. For the space of time it took to play a top 10 hit, the booth was silent. There was only Cilla and the lights and gauges on the control board. That was how she liked it best.<br><br>When she'd accepted the position with KHIP in Denver six months before, she'd wrangled for the 10:00-p.m.-to-2-a.m. slot, one usually reserved for the novice deejay. A rising success with ten years' experience behind her, she could have had one of the plum day spots when the listening audience was at its peak. She preferred the night, and for the past five years she'd carved out a name for herself in those lonely hours.<br><br>She liked being alone, and she liked sending her voice and music out to others who lived at night.<br><br>With an eye on the clock, Cilla adjusted her headphones. Between the fade-out of hit number four and the intro to hit number five, she crooned out the station's number four and the intro to hit number five, she crooned out the station's call letters and frequency. After a quick break when she popped in a cassette of recorded news, she would begin her favorite part of her show. The request line.<br><br>She enjoyed watching the phones light up, enjoyed hearing the voices. It took her out of her booth for fifty minutes every night and proved to her that there were people, real people with real lives, who were listening to her.<br><br>She lit a cigarette and leaned back in her swivel chair. This would be her last quiet moment for the next hour.<br><br>She didn't appear to be a restful woman. Nor, despite the voice, did she look like a smoldering femme fatale. There was too much energy in her face and in her long, nervous body for either. Her nails were unpainted, as was her mouth. She rarely found time in her schedule to bother with polish and paint. Her dark brandy-brown eyes were nearly closed as she allowed her body to charge up. Her lashes were long, an inheritance from her dreamy father. In contrast to the silky lashes and the pale, creamy complexion, her features were strong and angular. She had been blessed with a cloud of rich, wavy black hair that she ruthlessly pulled back, clipped back or twisted up in deference to the headphones.<br><br>With an eye on the elapsed-time clock, Cilla crushed out the cigarette and took a sip of water, then opened her mike. The On Air sign glowed green.<br><br>"That was for all the lovers out there, whether you've got someone to cuddle up with tonight or you wish you did. Stay tuned. This is Cilla O'Roarke, Denver. You're listening to KHIP. We're coming back with our request line."<br><br>As she switched on the tape for a commercial run, she glanced up. "Hey, Nick. How's it going?"<br><br>Nick Peters, the college student who served as an intern at the station, pushed up his dark-framed glasses and grinned. "I aced the Lit test."<br><br>"Way to go." She gratefully accepted the mug of steaming coffee he offered. "Is it still snowing?"<br><br>"Stopped about an hour ago."<br><br>She nodded and relaxed a little. She'd been worrying about Deborah, her younger sister. "I guess the roads are a mess."<br><br>"Not too bad. You want something to go with that coffee?"<br><br>She flicked him a smile, her mind too busy with other things to note the adoration in his eyes. "No, thanks. Help yourself to some stale doughnuts before you sign out." She hit a switch and spoke into the mike again.<br><br>As she read the station promos, he watched her. He knew it was hopeless, even stupid, but he was wildly in love with her. She was the most beautiful woman in the world to him, making the women at college look like awkward, gangling shadows of what a real woman should be. She was strong, successful, sexy. And she barely knew he was alive. When she noticed him at all, it was with a distractedly friendly smile or gesture.<br><br>For over three months he'd been screwing up his courage to ask her for a date. And fantasizing about what it would be like to have her attention focused on him, only him, for an entire evening.<br><br>She was completely unaware. Had she known where his mind had led him, Cilla would have been more amused than flattered. Nick was barely twenty-one, seven years her junior chronologically. And decades younger in every other way. She liked him. He was unobtrusive and efficient, and he wasn't afraid of long hours or hard work.<br><br>Over the past few months she'd come to depend on the coffee he brought her before he left the station. And to enjoy knowing she would be completely alone as she drank it.<br><br>Nick glanced at the clock. "I'll, ah, see you tomorrow."<br><br>"Hmm? Oh, sure. Good night, Nick." The moment he was through the door, she forgot about him. She punched one of the illuminated buttons on the phone. "KHIP. You're on the air."<br><br>"Cilla?"<br><br>"That's right. Who's this?"<br><br>"I'm Kate."<br><br>"Where are you calling from, Kate?"<br><br>"From home&#x2014;over in Lakewood. My husband's a cabdriver. He's working the late shift. We both listen to your show every night. Could you play 'Peaceful, Easy Feeling' for Kate and Ray?"<br><br>"You got it, Kate. Keep those home fires burning." She punched the next button. "KHIP. You're on the air."<br><br>The routine ran smoothly. Cilla would take calls, scribbling down the titles and the dedications. The small studio was lined with shelves crammed with albums, 45s, CDs, all labeled for easy access. After a handful of calls she would break to commercials and station promos to give herself time to set up for the first block of songs.<br><br>Some of the callers were repeaters, so she would chat a moment or two. Some were the lonely, calling just to hear the sound of another voice. Mixed in with them was the occasional loony that she would joke off the line or simply disconnect. In all her years of handling live phones, she couldn't remember a moment's boredom.<br><br>She enjoyed it tremendously, chatting with callers, joking. In the safety of the control booth she was able, as she had never been able face-to-face, to relax and develop an easy relationship with strangers. No one hearing her voice would suspect that she was shy or insecure.<br><br>"KHIP. You're on the air."<br><br>"Cilla."<br><br>"Yes. You'll have to speak up, partner. What's your name?"<br><br>"That doesn't matter."<br><br>"Okay, Mr. X." She rubbed suddenly damp palms on the thighs of her jeans. Instinct told her she would have trouble with this one, so she kept her finger hovering over the seven-second-delay button. "You got a request?"<br><br>"I want you to pay, slut. I'm going to make you pay. When I'm finished, you're going to thank me for killing you. You're never going to forget."<br><br>Cilla froze, cursed herself for it, then cut him off in the midst of a rage of obscenities. Through strict control she kept her voice from shaking. "Wow. Sounds like somebody's a little cranky tonight. Listen, if that was Officer Marks, I'm going to pay those parking tickets. I swear. This one goes out to Joyce and Larry."<br><br>She shot in Springsteen's latest hit single, then sat back to remove the headphones with trembling hands.<br><br>Stupid. She rose to pluck out the next selection. After all these years she should have known better than to freak over a crank call. It was rare to get through a shift without at least one. She had learned to handle the odd, the angry, the propositions and the threats as skillfully as she had learned to handle the control board.<br><br>It was all part of the job, she reminded herself. Part of being a public personality, especially on the night shift, where the weird always got weirder.<br><br>But she caught herself glancing over her shoulder, through the dark glass of the studio to the dim corridor beyond. There were only shadows, and silence. Beneath her heavy sweater, her skin was shivering in a cold sweat. She was alone. Completely.<br><br>And the station's locked, she reminded herself as she cued up the next selection. The alarm was set. If it went off, Denver's finest would scream up to the station within minutes. She was as safe here as she would be in a bank vault.<br><br>But she stared down at the blinking lights on the phone, and she was afraid.<br><br>The snow had stopped, but its scent lingered in the chill March air. As she drove, Cilla kept the window down an inch and the radio up to the maximum. The combination of wind and music steadied her.<br><br>Cilla wasn't surprised to find that Deborah was waiting up for her. She pulled into the driveway of the house she'd bought only six months before and noted with both annoyance and relief that all the lights were blazing.<br><br>It was annoying because it meant Deborah was awake and worrying. And it was a relief, because the quiet suburban street seemed so deserted and she felt so vulnerable. She switched off the ignition, cutting the engine and the sounds of Jim Jackson's mellow all-night show. The instant of total silence had her heart leaping into her throat.<br><br>Swearing at herself, she slammed the car door and, hunched in her coat against the wind, dashed up the stairs. Deborah met her at the door.<br><br>"Hey, don't you have a nine-o'clock class tomorrow?" Stalling, Cilla peeled off her coat and hung it in the closet. She caught the scent of hot chocolate and furniture polish. It made her sigh. Deborah always resorted to housecleaning when she was tense. "What are you doing up at this hour?"<br><br>"I heard. Cilla, that man&#x2014;"<br><br>"Oh, come on, baby." Turning, Cilla wrapped her arms around her sister. In her plain white terry-cloth robe, Deborah still seemed twelve years old to her. There was no one Cilla loved more. "Just one more harmless nut in a fruitcake world."<br><br>"He didn't sound harmless, Cilla." Though several inches shorter, Deborah held Cilla still. There was a resemblance between them&#x2014;around the mouth. Both their mouths were full, passionate and stubborn. But Deborah's features were softer, curved rather than angular. Her eyes, thickly lashed, were a brilliant blue. They were drenched now with concern. "I think you should call the police."<br><br>"The police?" Because this option had simply not occurred to her, Cilla was able to laugh. "One obscene call and you have me dashing to the cops. What kind of nineties woman do you take me for?"<br><br>Deborah jammed her hands in her pockets. "This isn't a joke."<br><br>"Okay, it's not a joke. But Deb, we both know how little the police could do about one nasty call to a public radio station in the middle of the night."<br><br>With an impatient sigh, Deborah turned away. "He really sounded vicious. It scared me."<br><br>"Me too."<br><br>Deborah's laugh was quick, and only a little strained. "You're never scared."<br><br>I'm always scared, Cilla thought, but she smiled. "I was this time. It shook me enough that I fumbled the delay button and let it broadcast." Fleetingly she wondered how much flak she'd get for that little lapse the next day. "But he didn't call back, which proves it was a one-shot deal. Go to bed," she said, passing a hand over her sister's dark, fluffy hair. "You're never going to be the best lawyer in Colorado if you stay up pacing all night."<br><br>"I'll go if you go."<br><br>Knowing it would be hours before her mind and body settled down, Cilla draped an arm over her sister's shoulders. "It's a deal."<br><br>He kept the room dark, but for the light of a few sputtering candles. He liked the mystic, spiritual glow of them, and their dreamy religious scent. The room was small, but it was crammed with mementos&#x2014;trophies from his past. Letters, snapshots, a scattering of small china animals, ribbons faded by time. A long-bladed hunting knife rested across his knees, gleaming dully in the shifting light. A well-oiled .45 automatic rested by his elbow on a starched crocheted doily.<br><br>In his hand he held a picture framed in rosewood. He stared at it, spoke to it, wept bitter tears over it. This was the only person he had ever loved, and all he had left was the picture to press to his breast.<br><br>John. Innocent, trusting John. Deceived by a woman. Used by a woman. Betrayed by a woman.<br><br>Love and hate entwined as he rocked. She would pay. She would pay the ultimate price. But first she would suffer.<br><br>The call&#x2014;one single ugly call&#x2014;came every night. By the end of a week, Cilla's nerves were frazzled. She wasn't able to make a joke of it, on or off the air. She was just grateful that now she had learned to recognize the voice, that harsh, wire-taut voice with that undercurrent of fury, and she would cut him off after the first few words.<br><br>Then she would sit there in terror at the knowledge that he would call back, that he was there, just on the other side of one of those blinking lights, waiting to torment her.<br><br>What had she done?<br><br>After she dropped in the canned news and commercial spots at 2:00 a.m., Cilla rested her elbows on the table and dropped her head into her hands. She rarely slept well or deeply, and in the past week she had managed only a few snatches of real sleep. It was beginning to tell, she knew, on her nerves, her concentration.<br><br>What had she done?<br><br></p><h2>While Passion Sleeps</h2><p>When Beth becomes dissatisfied with her marriage to Nathan Ridgeway, she struggles to find love with the arrogant Texan, Rafael Santana</p><p></p><h2>Emma (Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p>Emma Woodhouse imagines that she dominates those around her in the small town of Highbury, but her inept matchmaking creates problems for herself and others.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

The sun had plummeted mauvely into Thailand across the Mekhong River, and the hotel waitresses were lighting the little lamps that turned the simple sky-blue room into a mysterious nighttime cavern.<br><br>In an hour, a large Vietnamese delegation would be offered diversion there by members of the Lao People&#x2019;s Revolutionary Party Politburo. They&#x2019;d be made to watch poor country boys in fur hats do a Lao falling-over version of cossack dancing. They&#x2019;d be forced to suck semi-fermented rice whiskey from large tubs through long straws until they were dizzy. They&#x2019;d finally be coerced into embarrassing dances with solid girls in ankle-length skirts and crusty makeup.<br><br>And, assuming they survived these delights, they&#x2019;d be allowed to return to their rooms to sleep. Next day, with heads heavy as pressed rubber, they&#x2019;d sign their names to documents laying the foundations for the forthcoming Lao/Vietnam Treaty of Friendship, and they probably wouldn&#x2019;t remember very much about it. <br><br>But that was all to come. The understaffed hotel day shift had been replaced by an understaffed night crew. The sweating receptionist was ironing a shirt in the glass office behind her desk. The chambermaid was running a bowl of rice porridge up to a sick guest on the third floor.<br><br>Outside, an old guard, in a jacket so large it reached his knees, was locking the back gate that opened onto Sethathirat Road. At night, the gate kept out dogs and the occasional traveler tempted to come into the garden in search of respite from the cruel hot-season nights. An eight-foot wall protected the place as if it were something more special than it was.<br><br>Leaves floated in a greasy swimming pool. Obedient flowers stood in well-spaced regiments, better watered than any of the households outside along the street. And then there were the cages. They were solid concrete, so squat that a tall man would have to stoop to see inside. Two were empty. They housed only the spirits of animals temporarily imprisoned there: a monkey replaced by a deer, a peacock taking over the sentence of a wild dog.<br><br>But in the grim shadows of the third cage, something wheezed. It moved seldom, only to scratch lethargically at its dry skin. The unchristened black mountain bear was hosed down along with the bougainvilleas and given scraps from the kitchen from time to time. Its fur was patchy and dull, like a carpet in a well-trodden passage. Buddha only knew how the creature had survived for so long in its cramped jail, and the Lord had been banished from the socialist republic some fifteen months hence. <br><br>People came in the early evening and at weekends to stand in front of the cage and stare at her. She stared back, although her glazed bloodshot eyes could no longer make out details of the mocking faces. Children laughed and pointed. Brave fathers poked sticks in through the bars, but the black mountain bear no longer appeared to give a damn. <br><br>They naturally blamed the old guard the next day. &#x201c;Too much rice whiskey,&#x201d; they said. &#x201c;Slack,&#x201d; they said. The guard denied it, of course. He swore he&#x2019;d relocked the cage door. He&#x2019;d thrown the leftovers from the Vietnamese banquet into the animal&#x2019;s bowl and locked the cage. He was sure of it. He swore the beast was still in there when he did his rounds at four. He swore he had no idea how it could have gotten out, or where it could have gone. But they sacked him anyway.<br><br>After a panicked search of the grounds and the hotel buildings, the manager declared to his staff that the place was safe and it was a problem now for the police. In fact, he didn&#x2019;t think it would be wise to mention the escape to his guests at all. As far as he was concerned, the problem was over. <br><br>But for Vientiane, it had barely started. <br><br><b><br>Tomb Sweet Tomb</b><br><br>The sun baked everything in the new suburb. Comrade Civilai stepped from the hot black limousine and, without locking the doors, walked up to the concrete mausoleum where they&#x2019;d put Dr. Siri. The gate and the front door were open, and he could see clear through to the small yard at the back. There was no furniture to interrupt the view. <br><br>He kicked off his Sunday sandals and walked into the front room. It was as if the builders and decorators had just left. The walls were still virgin Wattay light-blue, to match the swimming-pool-colored Wattay airport. They were unencumbered by pictures or posters or photographs of heroes of the revolution. No French plaster ducks flew in formation. No clock ticked. If he didn&#x2019;t know Siri had lived here for a month, he would have guessed this to be a vacant house. <br><br>On his way to the back, he passed a small room where piles of clothes told him he was nearing a primitive life form. In the back yard, he discovered it. Dr. Siri Paiboun, reluctant national coroner, confused psychic, disheartened communist, swung gently on a hammock strung between two jackfruit saplings. A larger man would have brought them both down.<br><br>In his shadow, Saloop, rescued street dog and lifesaver, drooled onto the hot earth. He looked up with one eye, decided Civilai was too old and bald to be a threat, and returned to his dream. <br><br>A month earlier, the yard had been dirt and debris. Today it was a jungle. Siri had gone to great pains to recreate the environment in which he&#x2019;d spent the latter forty of his seventy-two years. For the past four weekends, he and his trusted morgue colleagues had set off into the outer suburbs and denuded them unashamedly. They&#x2019;d transported a variety of trees and shrubs back to this humble bunker&#x2013;the Party&#x2019;s thanks for his services.<br><br>&#x201c;I do hope I&#x2019;m not disturbing you,&#x201d; Civilai said, knowing full well how disturbing he was being. Siri&#x2019;s eerie green eyes opened slowly to see his best friend leaning over him.</p><h2>The Everything Indian Cookbook: 300 Tantalizing Recipes--From Sizzling Tandoori Chicken to Fiery Lamb Vindaloo</h2><p>Indian cuisine constitutes the exotic blend of flavors from the Himalayas in the North to the Eastern Bay of Bengal.

His body was riddled with tumors, his liver and spleen were enlarged, his lungs were filled with fluid, and he needed an oxygen mask to breathe. But when Mr. Wright heard that his doctor was conducting cancer research with a new drug called Krebiozen, which the media were touting as a potential miracle cure, he pleaded to be given treatments. Although it was against protocol, Dr. Klopfer honored Mr. Wright's request by giving him an injection of the drug, then left the hospital for the weekend, never expecting to see his patient again. But when he returned on Monday morning, he discovered that Mr. Wright's tumors had shrunk to half their original size, something that even radiation treatments could not have accomplished.</p> <p>"Good God!" thought Dr. Klopfer. "Have we finally found the silver bullet -- a cure for cancer?" Unfortunately, an examination of the other test patients showed no changes at all. Only Mr. Wright had improved. Was this a rare case of spontaneous remission, or was some other unidentified mechanism at work? The doctor continued to give injections to his recovering patient, and after ten days practically all signs of the disease had disappeared. Wright returned home, in perfect health.</p> <p>Two months later, the Food and Drug Administration reported that the experiments with Krebiozen were proving ineffective. Mr. Wright heard about the reports and immediately became ill. His tumors returned, and he was readmitted to the hospital. Now, Dr. Klopfer was convinced that the patient's <i>belief</i> in the drug's effectiveness had originally healed him. To test his theory, he decided to lie, telling Mr. Wright about a "new, super-refined, double-strength product" that was guaranteed to produce better results. Mr. Wright agreed to try this "new" version of what he believed had healed his tumors before, but in reality, Dr. Klopfer gave him injections of sterile water.</p> <p>Once again, Mr. Wright's recovery was dramatic. His tumors disappeared, and he resumed his normal life -- until the newspapers published an announcement by the American Medical Association under the headline "Nationwide Tests Show Krebiozen to Be a Worthless Drug in Treatment of Cancer."</p> <p>After reading this, Mr. Wright fell ill again, returned to the hospital, and died two days later. In a report published in the <i>Journal of Projective Techniques</i>, Dr. Klopfer concluded that when the power of Wright's optimistic beliefs expired, his resistance to the disease expired as well.</p> <p></p> <p>Each year, thousands of cases of remarkable recoveries are described, and although such "miracles" are often attributed to the power of faith and belief, the majority of scientists are skeptical of such claims. In the medical literature, spontaneous remissions -- at least when cancer is involved -- are extremely rare. Estimates range from one case in 60,000 to one in 100,000, although a definitive overview of the topic argues that perhaps one patient in 3,000 experiences a spontaneous remission. Moreover, the majority of oncologists believe that an unidentified biological mechanism is at work rather than a true miracle; and current hypotheses favor alterations in the body's cellular, immunological, hormonal, and genetic functioning over psychological mechanisms. But Mr. Wright's case is unique -- and one of the few to be documented during a university research project. The remissions of his cancer have been attributed to the effects of his mind on the biological functioning of his body -- in other words, on the biology of belief.</p> <p>Hundreds of mind-body experiments have been conducted -- including placebo studies and research on the power of meditation and prayer -- but few scientists have attempted to explain the underlying biology of belief. We have volumes of comprehensive statistics about the kinds of beliefs we hold, but our understanding of how and why belief "works" is still in its infancy, and most conclusions are still controversial.</p> <p>Fortunately, recent discoveries about the ways the brain creates memories, thoughts, behaviors, and emotions can provide a new template with which to examine the how and why of belief. What I will propose in this book is a practical model of how the brain works that will help you understand your own beliefs and the nature of reality. It will also help you see how all beliefs emerge from the perceptual processes of the brain, and how they are shaped by personal relationships, societal influences, and educational and spiritual pursuits. This understanding can then help us to discern the difference between destructive and constructive beliefs, skills that are essential if we are to adequately address important individual, interpersonal, and global problems.</p> <p>Copyright � 2006 by Andrew Newberg, MD, and Mark Robert Waldman</p></p><h2>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Techniques for Retraining Your Brain-Transcript Book</h2><p>This 583 page book is Transcript book of Lectures 1-24 by Prof Satterfield, Prof of Clinical Medicine, Director of Social and Behavioral Sciences&amp; Director of Behavioral Medicine. Why is it so hard to lose weight, stop smoking, or establish healthy habits? Why do couples argue about the same issues over and over? Why do so many people lie awake at night, stricken with worry and anxiety? Why is it so difficult to come to terms with a loved one's death, even if it's after a long illness? The answers to these questions - and the path to lasting change in your life - lie in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a well-tested collection of practical techniques for managing moods and modifying undesirable behaviors through self-awareness, critical analysis, and goal-oriented change. CBT illuminates the links between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and physical health and uses those connections to develop concrete plans for self-improvement. Built on a solid foundation of neurological and behavioral research, CBT is an approach almost anyone can use for promoting greater mental health and improving quality of life.</p><p></p><h2>General of the Army: George C.

She attended Oxford University, holds a graduate degree from the University of Cambridge, and lives in the Washington DC area. <i>Pagan Spring</i> is the third book in her Max Tudor series, which also includes <i>Wicked Autumn</i> and <i>A Fatal Winter</i>.</p>CHAPTER 1 <br>&nbsp; <br> <br> <i>New Moon</i> <br>Thursday, March 22 <br>The vernal equinox had come and gone, and Easter would soon be upon them. The Reverend Maxen &#x201c;Max&#x201d; Tudor was in his vicarage working at his computer, a machine so antiquated, it almost needed foot pedals to operate. He was rather feverishly trying to write a sermon on one of Saint Paul&#x2019;s letters to the Corinthians, a sermon that was beginning to irk even Max. Paul could sound so smug at times. So sure of himself. So holier-than&#x2014; <br>Inspired, Max began to write: &#x201c;Saint Paul at times appears to our modern world as the smug apostle&#x2014;a man holier-than-thou, a preachy know-it-all full of scoldings and reprimands, chiding others for the way they lived their lives. But the Corinthians&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>But the Corinthians, what? There was no <i>but.</i> Saint Paul at his worst had always been hard to take&#x2014;the garrulous, advice-giving uncle no one wanted to sit next to at dinner, the Polonius of his day. The fun-loving Corinthians had probably stampeded in their rush to avoid the old Gloomy Gus missionary. <br>Max, searching his mind for a more inspiring topic, a more accessible theme, a more man-of-the-people apostle, began playing with the various fonts in his word-processing software. Gothic typeface in deep purple for the stories of the apostles, orange Arial for the words of the angel Gabriel to Mary, and blue Garamond in italics for her replies. Max deliberated some more, then in twenty-point Gothic he typed &#x201c;Let there be light,&#x201d; and highlighted the words with the yellow text highlight function. <br>Well, <i>this</i> was getting him nowhere. He selected all the text on the page and with a sigh changed everything to boring old twelve-point black Times New Roman. He thought a moment, then keyed in &#x201c;And darkness was upon the face of the deep.&#x201d; <br>Backspace, backspace, backspace. He stole a glance at the copy of <i>Glossamer Living</i> magazine on his desk, left behind by one of his parishioners&#x2014;a sort of negative inspiration, since he and his parishioners were living in the season of Lent, a time for setting aside personal indulgences, most of which were featured between the covers of this publication. High fashion and fast cars; pricey houses, restaurants, and vacations. On the cover was a photograph of a castle garden in Normandy, with a bed of Technicolor tulips in the foreground. <br>How had it gotten to be springtime already? Max, leafing through his desk calendar, blinked with something like wonder, then looked at the watch on his wrist, as if that might confirm what he was seeing. The variable weather of the past few months had been disorienting, for humans as well as for plants and animals. It seemed to him the newborn lambs had arrived earlier this year. Easter, the most important day in the church calendar, would be here before he knew it&#x2014;or, at this rate, had a sermon ready for it. He noticed the full moon fell on Good Friday this year, which seemed fitting somehow. Awena called it the &#x201c;Egg Moon&#x201d;; he had no idea why. Some pagan tradition rolled into the Easter traditions, he thought, enjoying the unintentional pun. <br>The God Squad would be meeting soon to discuss the &#x201c;Eat, Pray, Plan&#x201d; retreat, and while preparing for these vestry meetings seemed a futile gesture, preparation was necessary to maintain some semblance of order. He also needed to schedule tryouts for instrumentalists for the Sunday services while the organist was away for the summer. Max so far had vetoed the zither and banjo, but that had left him with few options. Awena had offered to play her set of crystal singing bowls, but that was as yet a step too far for St. Edwold&#x2019;s. <br>And&#x2014; <i>oops</i>! There was the appointment with the bishop coming up in a few days&#x2019; time. How could he nearly have forgotten? The man&#x2019;s secretary had been most insistent it was important, but she hadn&#x2019;t known what it was about. Max, who could guess, took a red pencil out of the top drawer of his desk and drew a big star on his calendar by the appointment date. Then, still unwilling to return to his sermon, he scrabbled around in the drawer for a pencil sharpener and began honing all his pencils to a fine point. <br>As he procrastinated in this way, Max glanced out the casement window of the vicarage study. The slice of Nether Monkslip in his view was of a classic village whose roots predated recorded history, a place that had survived centuries of wars and feuds and conspiracies largely because it had managed to go unnoticed. It was a village of stone cottages and thatched roofs, and of timber and brick; of Tudor wattle and daub and Georgian houses and the occasional postwar development&#x2014;a mix of styles pleasing to the eye and just managing to avoid the chaotic. Max, from his favorite spot up on Hawk Crest, where he would rest with his dog, Thea, from the strenuous climb, found time evaporating as he gazed, trancelike, at the peaceful scene below. The villagers more often than not would be going about their shopping, or be huddled in little groups, often accompanied by a swirl of dogs. He was reminded of a toy village setting for an elaborate train set. Outlying fields were divided by drystone walls kept in perfect repair; on a clear night, he might see in the distance a ferry leaving Monkslip-super-Mare, lights ablaze. Once the weather warmed, there would be a duck race on the River Puddmill, an event to which Max looked forward with as much innocent pleasure as a child. <br>The eldest villagers of Nether Monkslip, most of whom descended from serfs, were rapidly dying off or selling up, to be replaced by Yuppies from afar. These transplants&#x2014;many his parishioners&#x2014;were today carrying bright umbrellas against a mild March drizzle. They often passed down the road fronting the vicarage, headed to or from the High Street, which is why Max had positioned his desk at the window for maximum viewing. Hedges in front of the window provided a bit of a screen for him to hide behind. <br>He saw Suzanna Winship slink by, in her dolce far niente way, throwing a provocative glance in the direction of the vicarage and metaphorically revving her engines, probably just to keep in practice. He watched Elka Garth of the Cavalier Tea Room and Garden bustle past, carrying supplies, her son loitering empty-handed in her wake. That he was with her at all meant she&#x2019;d managed to tear him momentarily from the video games he played so obsessively. <br>Then there came the ironmonger, delivering a roll of chicken wire, followed by the woman who created beaded-jewelry purses she sold over the Internet&#x2014;Jeanne something. And Annette Hedgepeth, who owned Cut and Dried, the local beauty salon. Annette was with two of her hairdressers, their three shiny well-coiffed heads&#x2014;one blond, one brown, one white&#x2014;together in furious discussion under a large blue umbrella. Hairstylists, he supposed they were called now. The eldest of them he knew by name, even though she was not a member of St. Edwold&#x2019;s, but attended a Catholic church in Monkslip-super-Mare. She was Gabrielle &#x201c;Gabby&#x201d; Crew&#x2014;a widowed aunt or some sort of relation to Mme. Lucie Cuthbert&#x2014;who would be at the dinner party to which he was invited Friday night. He knew little more about this woman with the beautiful white hair than that she was the type of person often to be seen with a yoga mat under her arm: She was a frequent habitu� of the yoga classes taught by Tara Raine at the back of Awena&#x2019;s Goddessspell shop. <br>The party was to be held at the new home of Frank and Lucie Cuthbert, just outside the village proper. The ostensible purpose of the gathering was to formally welcome four relative newcomers to the village; its, in reality, purpose was to showcase both the house and Lucie&#x2019;s expert French cooking. Two of the newcomers were a couple, Thaddeus and Melinda Bottle. Thaddeus Bottle needed no introduction, or so Max had been assured, since Thaddeus was legendary for his roles on London&#x2019;s West End stages as well as for his authorship of several plays. Much like Shakespeare, Thaddeus in retirement had returned to the village of his youth and bought its second-largest house. But there, Max somehow felt certain, all similarities stopped. Apart from the fact of Shakespeare&#x2019;s unrivaled genius, there was his differing taste in architecture: Shakespeare had his timber and brick New Place, and Thaddeus had a remodeled glass and synthetic-wood horror, which stood just past the train station on the road to Staincross Minster. The villagers called it &#x201c;Bottle Palace.&#x201d; <br>In addition to the hairstylist Gabby Crew&#x2014;who was living over Lucie and Frank&#x2019;s shop in the village until she could find other accommodation&#x2014;there would be the estate agent, Bernadina Steed, who had sold thespian Thaddeus and Melinda their new home. Bernadina had, in fact, lived in the area nearly four years, but like Max she was a newcomer in Village Standard Time. Village doctor Bruce Winship had also been invited, to make an even eight at table. <br>Max gathered he himself had been included to balance out the male-female ratio, his usual role. He had a suspicion from hints dropped by Mme. Cuthbert that Dr. Winship was intended as a potential match for the &#x201c;new&#x201d; estate agent. Somehow&#x2014;and Max did not yet suspect the reason&#x2014;the frantic matchmaking efforts aimed at his own eligible and attractively ruffled dark head had ceased. Max&#x2019;s involvement with Goddessspell shop owner Awena Owen, she of the faraway gaze and shiny smile and New Age beliefs, had retired him from the field, after his having defended his &#x201c;most eligible bachelor&#x201d; title in several skirmishes with matchmaking members of the Women&#x2019;s Institute&#x2014;particularly those with daughters, nieces, sisters, and maiden aunts of marriageable age. Bitter as the disappointment had been for many (particularly Dr. Winship&#x2019;s sister, Suzanna), no one seriously questioned Max&#x2019;s choice. Awena was too well liked for that, and the match, if a bit unusual, seemed (in a word) preordained. <br>Awena might herself have been invited, but she had gone to teach a weeklong residential course on &#x201c;Cooking and Curing with Herbs&#x201d; at the Women&#x2019;s Institute&#x2019;s Denman College in Oxfordshire. <br>Max recalled a conversation he&#x2019;d had with Awena when the Bottles had first moved into the area. <br>&#x201c;Thaddeus doesn&#x2019;t go out of his way to endear himself to the villagers,&#x201d; Awena had said. &#x201c;Nor did his wife at first, really, although the general trend is to feel sorry for her. It is felt she&#x2019;s made a bad bargain in marrying him and doesn&#x2019;t quite have the wit to know how to get out of it.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nor the money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nor the money,&#x201d; Awena had repeated. &#x201c;It so often comes down to that, doesn&#x2019;t it? There have been rumblings&nbsp;&#x2026; something about a prenuptial agreement.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How in the world did the villagers learn that so quickly?&#x201d; Max was genuinely stunned, although on reflection he realized this sort of thing was all in a day&#x2019;s work for the village grapevine, under the command of former schoolmistress Miss Pitchford. <br>&#x201c;Melinda drinks,&#x201d; Awena had added. &#x201c;Quite a bit. Which must cloud her judgment, not to mention drain her energy for leaving him&#x2014;assuming that&#x2019;s what she wants to do.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Perhaps I should go and visit them, even though they&#x2019;ve not joined St. Edwold&#x2019;s.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go,&#x201d; said Awena. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll visit her when I know the Greatest Star Ever to Shine on the West End is not around. I&#x2019;m liable to get much further that way. And it&#x2019;s a woman she needs to talk to&#x2014;that is my sense of things.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;All right,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I can see that.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Besides, I think she&#x2019;s used to trying to manipulate men to get what she wants. It will save you hours if I go, since we&#x2019;ll be able to cut through all that.&#x201d; <br>And so it was decided. Although Awena kept the details of her conversation with Melinda confidential, Max gathered that Melinda had been grateful for the offer of friendship. Once Awena learned Melinda was a great reader (somewhat to Awena&#x2019;s surprise), she made sure the newcomer was included in the village&#x2019;s book club meetings. Awena also mentioned the local writers&#x2019; group was always open to new members. Again to Awena&#x2019;s surprise, Melinda expressed an avid interest. <br>Max, after briefly returning his wandering attention to his sermon, thought how much he welcomed Lucie&#x2019;s dinner invitation as a novelty that would take his mind off Awena&#x2019;s absence. For his mind dwelt on Awena more than he had thought possible: She had quickly become a mainstay in his life. Several times a day, watching something on the telly or reading a book, he would turn in his chair to make some comment or to share a joke with her and be caught up short, realizing she was gone. It all somehow led him to think of what the world&#x2014;his world&#x2014;would be like without her in it ever again, and his heart would seize up with despair, his breath caught by the starkness of the vista painted by his imagination. Then he would give himself a mental shake&#x2014;she was only miles away&#x2014;and return to the task at hand. But still the shadow would have fallen on his day. <br>Max again checked his watch. It was not a good time of day to call her. Awena had set times for daily meditation, Max knew&#x2014;not unlike his own prescribed Anglican practice. <br>A shaft of sunlight just then broke from behind a cloud, enveloping the village in a haloish spring glow. &#x201c;From you have I been absent in the spring,&#x201d; thought Max. And he sighed, this time with a sublime happiness that radiated through his heart and his soul. He was as content in his personal life as a man could be without imploding from sheer joy. His concerns, if they could even be labeled as such, were minute. Yes, his sermon for the week would not quite come together, but he&#x2019;d think of <i>some</i>thing&#x2014;he always did. There was a recurring stain on one wall of the church of St. Edwold&#x2019;s, but that would be corrected by a new roof, paid for out of a wholly unexpected benefice from a wholly unexpected benefactor. A small patch of skin on his right arm stung from a cooking wound he&#x2019;d dealt himself the evening before. The local writers&#x2019; group was erupting with the usual skirmishes, and he was fending off requests to join and pour oil on those troubled waters: He had enough to do getting the sermons written. That several of the members were suggesting he, as a former MI5 agent, might write a spy thriller was added inducement for him to stay away. For one thing, he was bound by the Official Secrets Act from disclosing most of what he had done and who he had been during his years with the agency. For another thing, <i>no.</i> Just: no. <br>These were all, however, minor, negligible irritations. He was grateful. He was content, as content as any man could ever be. He had Awena in his life and she looked set to stay there, always at his side, at least in spirit&#x2014;a perfect way to describe Awena at any time. What more could he ask? <br>There was a stirring behind him, the whisper of small feet brushing against the carpet. A mouse might make such a noise. But this particular mouse was a child named Tom. His mother, Mrs. Hooser, had earlier brought a huge breakfast tray into the vicarage study. The boy must have followed her in and remained behind. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s so kind,&#x201d; Max had said to her, &#x201c;but really, you don&#x2019;t have to do this.&#x201d; He&#x2019;d started to say he&#x2019;d eaten already but then realized she might catch him in the lie, as there were no traces of such activity left in the kitchen as normally there would be.

Five-fifty. Six hundred. Six-fifty. Seven. Seven-fifty at the back. Eight.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bidding was keen by West Country standards. Morton&#x2019;s auction house in Bath was used to lots being knocked down without much show of enthusiasm. The dealer&#x2019;s faces were giving nothing away.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;A thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the increments would be in hundreds. Four or five bidders were still interested and Denis Doggart, the auctioneer, needed the help of his assistants to keep track of the small movements that signified bids.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Fifteen hundred. Sixteen. Seventeen on the phone.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heads turned. Not everyone in the room had realised bids were being phoned in. This wasn&#x2019;t a sale of impressionist paintings at Sotheby&#x2019;s. It was only the regular quarterly disposal of bits brought in to the Bath office for valuation, and most of them were bric-a-brac or tat.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart was unfazed. He had been told to expect two telephone bidders, from New York and Tokyo.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Two thousand.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The opening bidder shook his head. This was beyond his top figure. But the others were still in. The price mounted steadily, in two hundreds now.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;At three thousand pounds.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A stifled gasp came from the back where some onlookers had gathered.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart knew who the main bidders were, except one, a dark-haired man in a cream coloured linen jacket and white shirt with a red bow tie. This stranger, more than anyone, was driving the sale. A spark of determination had kindled in his blue eyes. But who the hell was he? He&#x2019;d obviously registered and been given his number. He&#x2019;d shown no interest in any of the hundred and twenty-eight lots that had gone before. Doggart would have liked to check with his clerk to learn the name, but controlling the auction demanded total concentration. <br> After three thousand, the bidding is stepped up by larger amounts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Four thousand in the front.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bow Tie Man was in it to win it.<br> A pause.<br> &#x2018;All done?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far from it. A new bidder raised his card, Sturgess, a London dealer who only made the trip to Bath when the catalogue contained something exceptional.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately Bow Tie topped the bid.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The interest from Japan and America had ended somewhere between three and four thousand. Sturgess and the mystery man could settle this between them. And now the bids were coming in with the pendulum precision that auctioneers love.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Five thousand, then.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who wears a bow tie these days? A few doctors and academics. The occasional eccentric. Certain auctioneers.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a moment&#x2019;s consideration, Sturgess nodded for five thousand five.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No hesitation in the response.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six thousand from the gentleman in the front. Are we there yet? A unique item of excellent provenance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new, aggressive voice broke in: &#x2018;Nobody move.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shock in the room was unimaginable. When an auctioneer is at work, his voice and his alone is all anyone expects to hear. The bidding is silent. An utterance from anyone else is an outrage.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If &#x201c;Nobody move&#x201d; was an order, it was not obeyed. After the collective jerk of surprise, all heads turned to see who had spoken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A larger shock awaited. The speaker was wearing a black mask that covered his face and was holding a handgun. He must have been standing all the time against the wall within ten feet of the auctioneer. He&#x2019;d slipped on the mask and produced the gun and spoken his two words while all the attention was on the bidders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Denis Doggart, on his rostrum, was supposed to be directing the show. He turned his head and said, &#x2018;What&#x2019;s this about?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up.&#x2019; The masked man said, &#x2018;Everyone stay right where you are and nobody will get hurt.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doggart said, &#x2018;This is intolerable.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I already told you to shut it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any doubt remained how serious the situation was, it evaporated when two more masked men with guns entered the saleroom by the door facing the rostrum. They marched up the aisle that was kept clear for safety reasons and took a grip on the handle of the wooden dolly supporting lot 129, the object currently under the hammer.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was too much for the bidder with the red bow tie. &#x2018;You can&#x2019;t steal that,&#x2019; he said in a shrill, appalled voice. &#x2018;Get away.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Shut up, mister,&#x2019; the first gunman said. &#x2018;Get on with it,&#x2019; he told his companions.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;It&#x2019;s under auction. I made the last bid. No one is taking it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Let them be, sir,&#x2019; the auctioneer said. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re armed.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;They&#x2019;re not having it. It&#x2019;s too precious.&#x2019; Bow Tie was up from his chair and striding towards the men starting to shift the heavy burden. &#x2018;Get your hands off.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The steady build-up of adrenalin during the auction must have given him extra courage, blind, foolhardy anger at the crime being committed in front of everyone. He was a slight man, no match for the crooks except in strength of will. He grabbed the sleeve of the nearest and succeeded in tugging his hand away from the dolly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gunman swung around. He had the automatic in his right hand. He levelled it and squeezed the trigger.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report echoed through the auction room, deafening everyone.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The force of the bullet sent Bow Tie Man crashing against a walnut table stacked with china. He hit the ground at the same time as a mass of cups, saucers and plates. Pandemonium followed, screams and shouts, some people diving for cover, others heading for the door. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The would-be thieves panicked like everyone else. Any thoughts of stealing lot 129 were abandoned without a word passing among them. All three dashed for the exit, stepping over their wounded victim.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A silver delivery van was waiting in the street outside with rear door open and a ramp in place. Two of the crooks dived in and hoisted the ramp aboard and the third slammed the door, dashed to the front and climbed in. The driver, obviously primed for the getaway, had the wheels in motion before the door closed. With a screech of rubber on tarmac, the getaway vehicle rounded the tight corners of Queen Square and was gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside the auction room fumes of cordite hung in the air. People were kneeling beside the victim, wanting to assist, but a man shot through the belly needs more than first aid. Blood had seeped through his clothes and dribbled from his mouth. He had turned as grey as the lump of stone he&#x2019;d been bidding for.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Who is he?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No idea.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Doesn&#x2019;t anyone know who the poor guy is?&#x2019; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;He was bidding. He must have signed in.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Good point. We can check.&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Someone better phone the police.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;I already did,&#x2019; Doggart said, down from his rostrum. &#x2018;They&#x2019;re on their way and so is the ambulance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Looks like he needs an undertaker&#x2019;s van, not an ambulance.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 2</b><br> &nbsp;<br> From saleroom to crime scene: a swift, harsh transformation.

It&#x2019;s not decorative. Would you give it house room?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Speaking personally, no, but people were bidding good money for it.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Did you find out how much?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six thousand and rising.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Six grand?&#x2019; Diamond said on a high note that startled the CSI team behind him. &#x2018;For this?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The object in front of them, standing on a wooden dolly, was a slab of weathered stone about one metre in length, half a metre wide and as thick as a mattress. Whoever had lifted it on was probably nursing a back strain.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Can you make out what it is?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t it supposed to be someone on horseback?&#x2019; Ingeborg said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Looks to me like a bunch of bananas.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face of the slab had been worked by a sculptor at some time in the remote past and any detail had long since been eroded. Thanks to the build-up of centuries of grime in the chiselled areas you could conceivably make out the outline of a horse and rider, Diamond was willing to admit. If so, the horse had thick legs, which was no bad thing. Either the sculptor&#x2019;s sense of proportion was faulty or the person in the saddle was an XXL.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;Does the writing give any clues?&#x2019; he asked.<br> Along the base was some damaged lettering: &#x2018;. . . N&nbsp; . .&nbsp; AMB . . RE&nbsp; ES . . Y&nbsp; SHE&nbsp; SAT.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingeborg shook her head. &#x2018;The last two words are all I can make out. I suppose they tell us the rider is female.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He eyed the carving again. &#x2018;You could have fooled me.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;The auction catalogue may throw some light. There must be some about.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded. &#x2018;See if you can find one while I have a word with the pathologist.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;<br> Bertram Sealy in his blue zip-suit was squatting in a mass of broken china beside the body and speaking into a tape-recorder. He flapped a hand as Diamond approached. &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t come any closer with your big feet.&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diamond let go of the do-not-cross tape as if he had never intended to creep under it. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not new to this. First impressions?&#x2019;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x2018;No great loss,&#x2019; the pathologist said.<br> There was a pause. &#x2018;That&#x2019;s callous even by your standards.&#x2019;<br> &#x2018;Bits of a tea service, cheap nineteen-fifties willow pattern.

Such an account of the human needs met by architecture remains sadly incomplete unless the expressive visual qualities of buildings are recognized as among their foremost effects.<br><br>A fresh approach is overdue&#x2014;an attempt to analyze these psychological qualities with the principles of visual perception. Such an attempt is made in this new volume by Rudolf Arnheim, who has been known, since the publication of his <i>Art and Visual Perception,</i> as an authority on the psychological interpretation of the visual arts. As he now turns his experienced eye to the visual aspects of buildings, he amplifies his theories with new features specific to the medium of the architect. Arnheim explores the unexpected perceptual consequences of architecture with his customary clarity and precision. Of particular interest is his thorough analysis of order and disorder in design, the nature of visual symbolism, and the relations between practical function and perceptual expression.<br><br>Arheim's ability to deal with theoretical principles in a concrete and easily accessible way assures him the attention of the general reader whose concern with the arts leads to the aesthetic and psychological aspects of the broader environment. At the same time, Arnheim's strikingly original approach will stimulate professionals and students concerned with the theory and practice of modern and historical architecture.</p><p><b>Rudolf Arnheim</b> is Professor Emeritus of the Psychology of Art at Harvard University.

Designed by Chip Kidd and boasting hundreds of examples of rare comic book art, interviews with writers and artists, working sketches and original character designs, Superman: The Complete History will satisfy the collector and captivate fans of all ages. 1998 DC Comics. SUPERMAN, all titles, characters, their distinctive likenesses, and related indicia are trademarks of DC Comics.</p><p>These days we devour super-sized meals, ogle strutting supermodels and experiment with superconductivity. But once upon a time there were only superheroes. Murmur their names, and from out of memory&#39;s deep emerge lazy summer afternoons spent on covered porches with a bottle of Orange Crush and a bag of Fritos, weekly bike rides to the revolving wire racks in corner drug stores and, of course, our increasingly daring leaps, from picnic tables and brick fireplaces, with an old sheet fluttering from 9-year-old shoulders: &#34;I can fly, I can fly.&#34; And we could -- if only during that moment when we flexed our knees and pushed off into the air. Then, for one blissful second, we were commensurate with our dreams. But, ah, those names, how they thrilled and fed our imaginations: the Flash, Green Lantern, Green Arrow, Aqua-Man and Hawkman, the Mighty Thor, and a little later the Silver Surfer, Spiderman and the X-Men. To the ignorant eyes of parents, our carefully tended stacks of 20, 50 or 200 issues of Action Comics, World&#39;s Finest, Detective Comics, Marvel Comics and so many others merely appeared to tell the same story, again and yet again: A gaudily costumed crime fighter battles a seemingly unbeatable enemy -- sometimes the oddly loquacious alien from another planet or dimension, sometimes the white-coated mad scientist with his destructo-ray, often (and best of all) the monstrous result of some laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong. Never such innocence again. Nowadays, comics have grown up and taken steroids: They are swarthy, mean, perverse, complex, adult. They even require specialized stores -- like X-rated videos -- and aspire to literature. &#34;Graphic novels&#34; can be intricate and wonderful -- ask any student of Neil Gaiman&#39;s The Sandman or look at the pastiche brilliance of Alan Moore&#39;s The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen -- but they would likely frighten or puzzle the children who lingered for hours over the early adventures of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman. Three oversized histories now document the life and times of these most durable of all the comic-book legends. Les Daniels&#39;s cleanly written text reveals not only the artistic, business and marketing decisions that have made Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman recognizable round the world, but also the ways in which each of their comics differs from the others in style and tone. Superman&#39;s adventures, for instance, were nearly always laced with humor and frequently relied on slightly screwball situations: For instance, Mr. Mxyzptlk -- the impish troublemaker from the future -- and Lois Lane&#39;s niece Susie Tompkins generally treated the Man of Steel as either an amusing buffoon or a playtime doll. Bizzarro -- the simple-minded partial clone of Superman, who resembled a crystallized Frankenstein&#39;s monster -- provoked endless chaos without being truly threatening. The entire reporting cast of the Daily Planet often tended to be exploited just for laughs: wide-eyed Jimmy Olsen, love-struck Lois Lane, even gruff editor Perry White with his favorite ejaculation, &#34;Great Caesar&#39;s ghost!&#34; By contrast, Batman dealt with obsession in all its forms (a theme underscored in Tim Burton&#39;s two Batman films). Bruce Wayne transforms himself into a caped crusader to avenge the brutal death of his parents. But his opponents are even more seriously damaged individuals, usually driven to crime by psychological trauma: the Joker, who yearns to be acclaimed the world&#39;s greatest comedian; Two-Face, who struggles with a Jekyll-and-Hyde personality after his disfigurement; Cat-Woman, a mousy secretary who escapes repression by releasing her inner tigress. Wonder Woman is, of course, the supreme avatar of that particular myth. The ludicrously bespectacled Diana Prince is actually an Amazon princess, at ease with her physical strength and beauty. She grew up in a world -- Paradise Island -- where sisterhood was truly powerful (and telepathic to boot). As a result, she prLes Daniels is a renowned comic book expert.

But instead of listening to garbled announcements, she has found a method of bypassing the horrors of the airport. This method&#x2014;changing planes&#x2014;enables Sita to visit fifteen societies not found on Earth. She will encounter cultures where the babble of children fades over time into the silence of adults; where whole towns exist solely for holiday shopping; where personalities are ruled by rage; where genetic experiments produce less than desirable results...<br><br><b>&#x201c;A fantastical travel guide, reminiscent of <i>Gulliver&#x2019;s Travels</i>, in which the narrator visits fifteen planes and describes the people, language, and customs with the eye of an anthropologist and the humor of a satirist.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA Today&nbsp;</i></b></p><p>At first, readers may find Ursula K. Le Guin's collection <i>Changing Planes</i> rather light, if not slight. However, as the reader continues through its sixteen stories (ten of which are original to this volume), the collection achieves considerable weight and power.<p> A punny conceit links the stories and provides the title of <i>Changing Planes</i>. Conceived before September 11, 2001, this conceit now, unfairly, looks odd. Trapped too many times in the misery of pre-terrorist airports, Sita Dulip discovered how to change planes: not airplanes, but planes of existence. Now the people of Sita's earth travel between alternate universes.</p><p> The stories in <i>Changing Planes</i> are strong expressions of Le Guin's considerable anthropological and psychological insight. However, these tales don't follow traditional plot structures or character-development methods. They read more like travelogues, or socio-anthropological articles on foreign nations or tribes. They explore exotic literary planes lying somewhere between Jorge Luis Borges's <i>ficciones</i> and Horace Miner's anthropological satire <i>Body Ritual Among the Nacirema</i>. However, unlike Miner's parody, Le Guin's wise tales are rarely satirical, though "The Royals of Hegn" sharply skewers the absurdity of royalty-worship, and "Great Joy" rightly attacks the boundless corporate criminality familiar to anyone who's read a newspaper since 2001.</p><p> One of America's greatest authors, Ursula K. Le Guin has received the National Book Award, the Newberry Award, the PEN/Malamud Award, five Nebula Awards, and five Hugo Awards. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>In this collection, Ursula K. Le Guin, winner of the National Book Award and the PEN/Malamud Award, presents a world where there is a better way of changing planes.<br><br>Missing a flight, waiting in an airport, listening to garbled announcements-who doesn't hate that misery?<br><br>But Sita Dulip from Cincinnati finds a method of bypassing the crowds at the desks, the long lines at the toilets, the nasty lunch, the whimpering children and punitive parents, the bookless bookstores, the blue plastic chairs bolted to the floor.<br><br>A mere kind of twist and a slipping bend, easier to do than to describe, takes her not to Denver but Strupsirts, a picturesque region of waterspouts and volcanoes, or Djeyo, where she can stay for two nights in a small hotel with a balcony overlooking the amber Sea of Somue.

How do Christians address this issue in a faithful way?<br><br>This evangelically centered but ecumenically informed introduction to ecological theology (ecotheology) explores the global dimensions of creation care, calling Christians to meet contemporary ecological challenges with courage and hope. The book provides a biblical, theological, ecological, and historical rationale for earthcare as well as specific practices to engage both individuals and churches.

Fletcher Harper</b>, executive director, GreenFaith<br> "Situating the call for creation care in the authors' stories and experiences with eco-ethics in church gives this book a vitality and embodied feel rare in theological literature. Giving the personal backstories to the book, moreover, makes it a narrative of spiritual renewal rather than just an academic work. Their experiences in evangelical churches personify, and will resonate with many, the wider ambivalence toward creation care in evangelical churches. Yet this journey toward creation care, although arising from spiritual angst with their experiences in evangelical churches, did not lead the authors away from their evangelical convictions but was the yield of mining biblical and evangelical, as well as ecumenical, theological resources. Theologically grounded and geared toward showing the way to life practices that are eco-sustainable. This book is not only an excellent resource in how biblical, historical, and contemporary Christian theology relates to creation care, but also, given its grounding in personal narratives, an effective textbook for college and seminary classrooms as well as church groups endeavoring to care for God's good earth. They effectively give theological substance and concrete pathways for pursuing Christian creation care."&nbsp;--<b>Steven M.

When the British set fire to Washington D.C., in 1814, Dolley saved one of our country&#39;s greatest treasures, a portrait of George Washington, before fleeing for her life.</p><p>David Abraham Adler (born April 10, 1947) is the author of nearly 200 books for children and young adults, most notably the Cam Jansen mystery series, the &#34;Picture Book of...&#34; series, and several acclaimed works about the Holocaust for young readers. Adler was born in New York City, New York. He graduated from Queens College in 1968 with a bachelor&#39;s degree in economics and education. For the next nine years, he worked as a mathematics teacher for the New York City Board of Education, while taking classes towards a master&#39;s degree in marketing, a degree he was awarded by New York University in 1971. In that same year, a question from his then-three-year-old nephew inspired Adler to write his first story, A Little at a Time, subsequently published by Random House in 1976. Adler&#39;s next project, a series of math books, drew on his experience as a math teacher. In 1977, he created his most famous character, Cam Jansen, originally featured in Cam Jansen and the Mystery of the Stolen Diamonds, which was published that year. Adler married psychologist Renee Hamada in 1973, and their first child, Michael, was born in 1977. By that time Adler had taken a break from teaching and, while his wife continued her work, he stayed home, took care of Michael, and began a full-time writing career. Adler has three children and one grandson. He lives in Woodmere, New York.Grade 3&#x2013;5&#x2014;Adler's picture-book biography focuses mainly on the War of 1812, but also mentions Madison's contributions to the Constitution and the creation of the three branches of government. Although this is a biography of the couple, there is more specific information on James Madison than on Dolley. Still, readers do learn some interesting facts about her, such as how she rescued a portrait of George Washington while the Executive Mansion burned. Adler's writing is clear yet not oversimplified, and is without fictionalization. An interesting book to read while studying the Constitution and the different branches of government, this is a reliable source for students to kick-start their presidential and/or governmental history research as well as a good choice for general reading.&#x2014;<i>Sarah O'Holla, Village Community School, New York City</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Although I don&#x2019;t know how far back that space goes&#x2014;how many years it spans. That&#x2019;s the thing about voids: they can be as short as the blink of an eye, or they can be infinite. Consuming your entire existence in a flash of meaningless white. Leaving you with nothing.<br>No memories.<br>No names.<br>No faces.<br>Every second that ticks by is new. Every feeling that pulses through me is foreign. Every thought in my brain is like nothing I&#x2019;ve ever thought before. And all I can hope for is one moment that mirrors an absent one. One fleeting glimpse of familiarity.<br>Something that makes me&nbsp;... <i>me</i>.<br>Otherwise, I could be anyone.<br>Forgetting who you are is so much more complicated than simply forgetting your name. It&#x2019;s also forgetting your dreams. Your aspirations. What makes you happy. What you pray you&#x2019;ll never have to live without. It&#x2019;s meeting yourself for the first time, and not being sure of your first impression.<br>After the rescue boat docked, I was brought here. To this room. Men and women in white coats flutter in and out. They stick sharp things in my arm. They study charts and scratch their heads. They poke and prod and watch me for a reaction. They want something to be wrong with me. But I assure them that I&#x2019;m fine. That I feel no pain.<br>The fog around me has finally lifted. Objects are crisp and detailed. My head no longer feels as though it weighs a hundred pounds. In fact, I feel strong. Capable. Anxious to get out of this bed. Out of this room with its unfamiliar chemical smells. But they won&#x2019;t let me. They insist I need more time.<br>From the confusion I see etched into their faces, I&#x2019;m pretty sure it&#x2019;s <i>they</i> who need the time.<br>They won&#x2019;t allow me to eat any real food. Instead they deliver nutrients through a tube in my arm. It&#x2019;s inserted directly into my vein. Inches above a thick white plastic bracelet with the words <i>Jane Doe</i> printed on it in crisp black letters.<br>I ask them why I need to be here when I&#x2019;m clearly not injured. I have no visible wounds. No broken bones. I wave my arms and turn my wrists and ankles in wide circles to prove my claim. But they don&#x2019;t respond. And this infuriates me.<br>After a few hours, they determine that I&#x2019;m sixteen years old. I&#x2019;m not sure how I&#x2019;m supposed to react to this information. I don&#x2019;t <i>feel</i> sixteen. But then again, how do I know what sixteen feels like? How do I know what <i>any</i> age feels like?<br>And how can I be sure that they&#x2019;re right? For all I know, they could have just made up that number. But they assure me that they have qualified tests. Specialists. Experts. And they all say the same thing.<br>That I&#x2019;m sixteen.<br>The tests can&#x2019;t tell me my name, though. They can&#x2019;t tell me where I&#x2019;m from. Where I live. Who my family is. Or even my favorite color.<br>And no matter how many &#x201c;experts&#x201d; they shuttle in and out of this room, no one can seem to explain why I&#x2019;m the only survivor of the kind of plane crash no one survives.<br>They talk about something called a passenger manifest. I&#x2019;ve deduced that it&#x2019;s a kind of master list. A register of everyone who boarded the plane.<br>I&#x2019;ve also deduced that I&#x2019;m not on it.<br>And that doesn&#x2019;t seem to be going over very well with anyone.<br>A man in a gray suit, who identifies himself as Mr. Rayunas from Social Services, says he&#x2019;s trying to locate my next of kin. He carries around a strange-looking metal device that he calls a cell phone. He holds it up to his ear and talks. He also likes to stare at it and stab at tiny buttons on its surface. I don&#x2019;t know what my &#x201c;next of kin&#x201d; is, but by the look on his face, he&#x2019;s having trouble locating it.<br>He whispers things to the others. Things I&#x2019;m assuming he doesn&#x2019;t want me to hear. But I hear them anyway. Foreign, unfamiliar words like &#x201c;foster care&#x201d; and &#x201c;the press&#x201d; and &#x201c;minor.&#x201d; Every so often they all pause and glance over at me. They shake their heads. Then they continue whispering.<br>There&#x2019;s a woman named Kiyana who comes in every hour. She has dark skin and speaks with an accent that makes it sound like she&#x2019;s singing. She wears pink. She smiles and fluffs my pillow. Presses two fingers against my wrist. Writes stuff down on a clipboard. I&#x2019;ve come to look forward to her visits. She&#x2019;s kinder than the others. She takes the time to talk to me. Ask me questions. Real ones. Even though she knows I don&#x2019;t have any of the answers.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re jus&#x2019; so beautiful,&#x201d; she says to me, tapping her finger tenderly against my cheek. &#x201c;Like one of those pictures they airbrush for the fashion magazines, you know?&#x201d;<br>I don&#x2019;t know. But I offer her a weak smile regardless. For some reason, it feels like an appropriate response.<br>&#x201c;Not a blemish,&#x201d; she goes on. &#x201c;Not one flaw. When you get your memory back, you&#x2019;re gonna have to tell me your secret, love.&#x201d; Then she winks at me.<br>I like that she says <i>when</i> and not <i>if</i>.<br>Even though I don&#x2019;t remember learning those words, I understand the difference.<br>&#x201c;And those eyes,&#x201d; she croons, moving in closer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen sucha color. Lavender, almos&#x2019;.&#x201d; She pauses, thinking, and leans closer still. &#x201c;No. <i>Violet.</i>&#x201d; She smiles like she&#x2019;s stumbled upon a long-lost secret. &#x201c;I bet that&#x2019;s your name. Violet. Ring any bells?&#x201d;<br>I shake my head. Of course it doesn&#x2019;t.<br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she says, straightening the sheets around my bed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna call you that anyway. Jus&#x2019; until you remember the real one. Much nicer soundin&#x2019; than Jane Doe.&#x201d;<br>She takes a step back, tilts her head to the side. &#x201c;Sucha pretty girl. Do you even remember whatcha look like, love?&#x201d;<br>I shake my head again.<br>She smiles softly. Her eyes crinkle at the corners. &#x201c;Hang on then. I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d;<br>She leaves the room. Returns a moment later with an oval-shaped mirror. Light bounces off it as she walks to my bedside. She holds it up.<br>A face appears in the light pink frame.<br>One with long and sleek honey-brown hair. Smooth golden skin. A small, straight nose. Heart-shaped mouth. High cheekbones. Large, almond-shaped purple eyes.<br>They blink.<br>&#x201c;Yes, that&#x2019;s you,&#x201d; she says. And then, &#x201c;You musta been a model. Such perfection.&#x201d;<br>But I don&#x2019;t see what she sees. I only see a stranger. A person I don&#x2019;t recognize. A face I don&#x2019;t know. And behind those eyes are sixteen years of experiences I fear I&#x2019;ll never be able to remember. A life held prisoner behind a locked door. And the only key has been lost at sea.<br>I watch purple tears form in the reflecting glass.<br>2<br>COVERAGE<br>&#x201c;Mystery continues to cloud the tragic crash of Freedom Airlines flight 121, which went down over the Pacific Ocean yesterday evening after taking off from Los Angeles International Airport on a nonstop journey to Tokyo, Japan. Experts are working around the clock to determine the identity of the flight&#x2019;s only known survivor, a sixteen-year-old girl who was found floating among the wreckage, relatively unharmed. Doctors at UCLA Medical Center, where she&#x2019;s being treated, confirm that the young woman has suffered severe amnesia and does not remember anything prior to the crash. There was no identification found on the girl and the Los Angeles Police have been unable to match her fingerprints or DNA to any government databases. According to a statement announced by the FAA earlier this morning, she was not believed to be traveling with family and no missing-persons reports matching her description have been filed.<br>&#x201c;The hospital released this first photo of the girl just today, in the hope that someone with information will step forward. Authorities are optimistic that...&#x201d;<br>I stare at my face on the screen of the thin black box that hangs above my bed. Kiyana says it&#x2019;s called a television. The fact that I didn&#x2019;t know this disturbs me. Especially when she tells me that there&#x2019;s one in almost every household in the country.<br>The doctors say I <i>should</i> remember things like that.

I can&#x2019;t remember my own face but I know that the digits between one and ten are the same now as they were before I lost everything. I know I must have learned them at some point in my eclipsed life. And that&#x2019;s as close to a sense of familiarity as I&#x2019;ve gotten.<br>I count to keep myself occupied. To keep my mind filled with something other than abandoned space. In counting I&#x2019;m able to create facts. Items I can add to the paltry list of things that I know.<br>I know that someone named Dr. Schatzel visits my room every fifty-two minutes and carries a cup of coffee with him on every third visit. I know that the nurses&#x2019; station is twenty to twenty-four footsteps away from my room, depending on the height of the person on duty. I know that the female newscaster standing on the curb at Los Angeles International Airport blinks fifteen times per minute. Except when she&#x2019;s responding to a question from the male newscaster back in the studio. Then her blinks increase by 133 percent.<br>I know that Tokyo, Japan, is a long way for a sixteen-year-old girl to be traveling by herself.<br>Kiyana enters my room and frowns at the screen. &#x201c;Violet, baby,&#x201d; she says, pressing a button on the bottom that ca...</p><h2>Truth: A Novel</h2><p><p>Winner of the 2010 Miles Franklin Award</p><p>Inspector Stephen Villani, head of homicide in Melbourne, Australia, has a full agenda: a murdered woman in a penthouse apartment, three men butchered in a sadistic rampage, a tattoo-faced drug dealer corrupting his rebellious daughter, a crumbling marriage. As these events begin to unfold, Villani finds himself immersed in an unfamiliar world of political scandal and ethical ambiguity, where honesty is a resource in very short supply. Peter Temple&#x2019;s <i>Truth </i>is an intricate, beautifully written novel of suspense.</p></p><p><p>Peter Temple is the author of eight crime novels, five of which have won the Ned Kelly Award for Crime Fiction. He has worked as a journalist and editor for newspapers and magazines in several countries. He lives in Victoria, Australia.</p><br>On the Westgate Bridge, behind them a flat in Altona, a dead woman, a girl really, dirty hair, dyed red, pale roots, she was stabbed too many times to count, stomach, chest, back, face. The child, male, two or three years old, his head was kicked. Blood everywhere. On the nylon carpet, it lay in pools, a chain of tacky black ponds.<br>Villani looked at the city towers, wobbling, unstable in the sulphurous haze. He shouldn&#x2019;t have come. There was no need. &#x201c;This airconditioner&#x2019;s fucked,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Second one this week.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Never go over here without thinking,&#x201d; said Birkerts.<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;My grandad. On it.&#x201d;<br>One spring morning in 1970, the bridge&#x2019;s half-built steel frame stood in the air, it crawled with men, unmarried men, men with wives, men with wives and children, men with children they did not know, men with nothing but the job and the hard, hard hangover and then Span 10&#x2013;11 failed.<br>One hundred and twelve metres of newly raised steel and concrete, two thousand tonnes.<br>Men and machines, tools, lunchboxes, toilets, whole sheds&#x2014;even, someone said, a small black dog, barking&#x2014;all fell down the sky. In moments, thirty-five men were dead or dying, bodies broken, sunk in the foul grey crusted sludge of the Yarra&#x2019;s bank. Diesel fuel lay everywhere. A fire broke out and, slowly, a filthy plume rose to mark the scene.<br>&#x201c;Dead?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;No, taking a shit, rode the dunny all the way down.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Certainly passed on that shit-riding talent,&#x201d; said Villani, thinking about Singleton, who couldn&#x2019;t keep his hands off the job, either, couldn&#x2019;t stay in the office. It was not something to admire in the head of Homicide.<br>On the down ramp, Birkerts&#x2019;s phone rang, it was on speaker.<br>Finucane&#x2019;s deep voice:<br>&#x201c;Boss. Boss, Altona, we&#x2019;re at the husband&#x2019;s brother&#x2019;s place in Maidstone. He&#x2019;s here, the hubby, in the garage. Hosepipe. Well, not a hosepipe, black plastic thing, y&#x2019;know, like a pool hose?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Excellent work,&#x201d; said Birkerts. &#x201c;Could&#x2019;ve been in Alice Springs by now. Tennant Creek.&#x201d;<br>Finucane coughed. &#x201c;So, yeah, maybe the scientists can come on here, boss. Plus the truck.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sort that out, Fin. Might be pizza, though.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell the wife hold the T-bones.&#x201d;<br>Birkerts ended the call.<br>&#x201c;Closed this Altona thing in an hour,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s pretty neat for the clearance.&#x201d;<br>Villani heard Singo:<br>Fuck the clearance rate. Worry about doing the job properly.<br>Joe Cashin had thought he was doing the job properly and it took the jaws to open the car embedded in the fallen house. Diab was dead, Cashin was breathing but no hope, too much blood lost, too much broken and ruptured.<br>Singleton only left the hospital to sit in his car, the old Falcon. He aged, grey stubble sprouted, his silken hair went greasy. After the surgery, when they told him Joe had some small chance and allowed him into the room, he took Joe&#x2019;s slack hand, held it, kissed its knuckles. Then he stood, smoothed Joe&#x2019;s hair, bent to kiss Joe&#x2019;s forehead.<br>Finucane was there, he was the witness, and he told Villani. They did not know that Singleton was capable of such emotion.<br>The next time Cashin came out of hospital, the second time in three years, he was pale as a barked tree. Singo was dead by then, a second stroke, and Villani was acting boss of Homicide.<br>&#x201c;The clearance rate,&#x201d; Villani said. &#x201c;A disappointment to me to hear you use the term.&#x201d;<br>His phone.<br>Gavan Kiely, deputy head of Homicide, two months in the job.<br>&#x201c;We have a dead woman in the Prosilio building, that&#x2019;s in Docklands,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Paul Dove&#x2019;s asked for assistance.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Out of his depth. I&#x2019;m off to Auckland later but I can go.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; said Villani. &#x201c;I bear this cross.&#x201d;<br>He went down the passage into the bedroom, a bed big enough for four sleepers, mattress naked, pillows bare. Forensic had finished there. He picked up a pillow with his fingertips, sniffed it.<br>Faintest smell of perfume. Deeper sniff. The other pillow. Different perfume, slightly stronger smell.<br>He walked through the empty dressing room into the bathroom, saw the glass bath and beside it a bronze arm rising from the floor, its hand offering a cake of soap.<br>She was on the plastic bag in a yoga posture of rest&#x2014;legs parted, palms up, scarlet toenails, long legs, sparse pubic hair, small breasts. His view was blocked by the shoulder of a kneeling forensic tech. Villani stepped sideways and saw her face, recoiled. For a terrible heart-jumping instant, he thought it was Lizzie, the resemblance was strong.<br>He turned to the wall of glass, breathed out, his heart settled. The drab grey bay lay before him and, between the Heads, a pinhead, a container ship. Gradually it would show its ponderous shape, a huge lolling flat-topped steel slug bleeding rust and oil and putrid waste.<br>&#x201c;Panic button,&#x201d; said Dove. He was wearing a navy suit, a white shirt and a dark tie, a neurosurgeon on his hospital rounds.<br>Villani looked: rubber, dimpled like a golf ball, set in the wall between the shower and the head of the bath.<br>&#x201c;Nice shower,&#x201d; said Dove.<br>A stainless-steel disc hung above a perforated square of metal. On a glass shelf, a dozen or more soap bars were displayed as if for sale.<br>The forensic woman said, &#x201c;Broken neck. Bath empty but she&#x2019;s damp.&#x201d;<br>She was new on the job, Canadian, a mannish young woman, no make-up, tanned, crew cut.<br>&#x201c;How do you break your neck in the bath?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s hard to do it yourself. Takes a lot to break a neck.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br>She didn&#x2019;t get his tone. &#x201c;Absolutely. Takes force.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What else?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;Nothing I can see now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The time? Inspired guess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Less than twenty-four or I have to go back to school.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;ll be pleased to see you. Taken the water temperature into account?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>Villani pointed. The small digital touchscreen at the door was set at 48 degrees Celsius.<br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t see that,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I would have. In due course.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No doubt.&#x201d;<br>Little smile. &#x201c;Okay, Lance,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Zip it.&#x201d;<br>Lance was a gaunt man, spade beard. He tried to zip the bag, it stuck below the woman&#x2019;s breasts. He moved the slider back and forth, got it free, encased her in the plastic.<br>Not ungently, they lifted the bag onto the trolley.<br>When they were gone, Dove and Weber came to him.<br>&#x201c;Who owns this?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re finding out,&#x201d; said Dove. &#x201c;Apparently it&#x2019;s complicated.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The management. Waiting for us downstairs.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You want me to do it?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>Dove touched a cheekbone, unhappy. &#x201c;That would be helpful, boss.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You want to do it, Web?&#x201d; said Villani, rubbing it in to Dove.<br>Weber was mid-thirties, looked twenty, an unmarried evangelical Christian. He came with plenty of country experience: mothers who drowned babies, sons who axed their mothers, access fathers who wasted the kids. But Old Testament murders in the rural welfare sumps didn&#x2019;t prepare you for dead women in apartments with private lifts, glass baths, French soaps and three bottles of Mo�t in the fridge.<br>&#x201c;No, boss,&#x201d; he said.<br>They walked on the plastic strip, passed through the apartment&#x2019;s small pale marble hall, through the front door into a corridor. They waited for the lift.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; Villani said.<br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; said Dove. &#x201c;Know nothing about her. There&#x2019;s no ID.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Neighbours?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t any. Six apartments on this floor, all empty.&#x201d;<br>The lift came, they fell thirty floors. On the sixth, at a desk, three dark suits, two men and a woman, waited. The plump fiftyish man came forward, pushing back limp hair.<br>&#x201c;Alex Manton, building manager,&#x201d; he said.<br>Dove said, &#x201c;This is Inspector Villani, head of Homicide.&#x201d;<br>Manton offered his hand. It felt dry, chalky.<br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s talk in the meeting space, Inspector,&#x201d; Manton said.<br>The room had a painting on the inner wall, vaguely marine, five metres by three at least, blue-grey smears, possibly applied with a mop. They sat at a long table with legs of chromed pipe.<br>&#x201c;Who owns the apartment?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;A company called Shollonel Pty.

That triggers a buzzer in the apartment. If it isn&#x2019;t closed in two minutes, there&#x2019;s a security alert and they ring the apartment. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, they go up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So there in four, five minutes?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>Sylvia looked at Manton, who was looking at the other man, fortyish, head like a glans.<br>&#x201c;Obviously not quite,&#x201d; said the man.<br>&#x201c;You are?&#x201d; said Villani.<br>&#x201c;David Condy, head of security for the apartments and the hotel.&#x201d; He was English.<br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s not quite mean?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m told the whole electronic system failed its first big test last night.

Then twelve more floors of apartments, eight to a floor. Then the casino&#x2019;s four floors, the hotel&#x2019;s ten floors, two floors of catering, housekeeping.

Sleep patterns may be the most obvious manifestation of the highly individualized biological clocks we inherit, but these clocks also regulate bodily functions from digestion to hormone levels to cognition. Living at odds with our internal timepieces, Till Roenneberg shows, can make us chronically sleep deprived and more likely to smoke, gain weight, feel depressed, fall ill, and fail geometry. By understanding and respecting our internal time, we can live better.</p><p> </p><p> <i>Internal Time</i> combines storytelling with accessible science tutorials to explain how our internal clocks work-for example, why morning classes are so unpopular and why "lazy" adolescents are wise to avoid them. We learn why the constant twilight of our largely indoor lives makes us dependent on alarm clocks and tired, and why social demands and work schedules lead to a social jet lag that compromises our daily functioning.</p><p> </p><p> Many of the factors that make us early or late "chronotypes" are beyond our control, but that doesn't make us powerless. Roenneberg recommends that the best way to sync our internal time with our external environment and feel better is to get more sunlight. Such simple steps as cycling to work and eating breakfast outside may be the tickets to a good night's sleep, better overall health, and less grouchiness in the morning.</p></p><p>Till Roenneberg is Professor at the Institute of Medical Psychology at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich.<i>Internal Time</i> is an accessible, up-to-date overview of a subject that is important to all of us.

(Richard Wiseman <i>New Scientist</i> 2012-04-28)<br><br>Time really is of the essence, says medical psychologist Till Roenneberg. By neglecting our body clocks--which rarely run in synchrony with the crazily cranked-up pace of modern life--we can develop "social jetlag," endangering our health and careers.

This all-original anthology from the distinguished trio of Greenberg, Lellenberg and Stashower is an improvement over a similar volume, Michael Reaves and John Pelan's <i>Shadows over Baker Street</i> (2003), which attempted to combine the sleuth with the eldritch horrors of H.P. Lovecraft. Few of the 10 stories in this follow-up, however, raise even a momentary chill. The highlight, Gillian Linscott's "The Adventure of the Late Orang Outang," captures Conan Doyle's style, even if the mystery is less than baffling. Sherlockians may find the three essays at the end of interest (one is by Caleb Carr), but many readers might have preferred that the editors had instead included stories from such Watson emulators as Barrie Roberts and Denis Smith, both of whom have written superb Holmes tales with supernatural overtones. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Lady Jane, the eldest, was thrust center stage by greedy men and uncompromising religious politics when she briefly succeeded Henry&#x2019;s son, the young Edward I. Dubbed &#x201c;the Nine Days Queen&#x201d; after her short, tragic reign from the Tower of London, Jane has over the centuries earned a special place in the affections of the English people as a &#x201c;queen with a public heart.&#x201d; But as de Lisle reveals, Jane was actually more rebel than victim, more leader than pawn, and Mary and Katherine Grey found that they would have to tread carefully in order to avoid sharing their elder sister&#x2019;s violent fate.<br><br> Navigating the politics of the Tudor court after Jane&#x2019; s death was a precarious challenge. Katherine Grey, who sought to live a stable life, earned the trust of Mary I, only to risk her future with a love marriage that threatened Queen Elizabeth&#x2019;s throne. Mary Grey, considered too petite and plain to be significant, looked for her own escape from the burden of her royal blood&#x2013;an impossible task after she followed her heart and also incurred the queen&#x2019;s envy, fear, and wrath.<br><br> Exploding the many myths of Lady Jane Grey&#x2019;s life, unearthing the details of Katherine&#x2019;s and Mary&#x2019;s dramatic stories, and casting new light on Elizabeth&#x2019;s reign, Leanda de Lisle gives voice and resonance to the lives of the Greys and offers perspective on their place in history and on a time when a royal marriage could gain a woman a kingdom or cost her everything.</p><p>Leanda de Lisle is the author of After Elizabeth. She was educated at Somerville College, Oxford, where she earned a master of arts degree in modern history. A successful journalist and broadcaster, she has been a columnist for <i>The Spectator, The Guardian, Country Life</i>, and the <i>Daily Express</i>, as well as writing for <i>The Times,</i> the <i>Daily Mail</i>, the<i> New Statesman</i>, and <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>. She lives in Leicestershire with her husband and three children.<i>Chapter One<br>Beginning &nbsp; <br></i><br>Frances, Marchioness of Dorset, prepared carefully for the birth of her child. It was an anxious time, but following the traditions of the lying-in helped allay fears of the perils of labor. The room in which she was to have her baby had windows covered and keyholes blocked. Ordinances for a royal birth decreed that only one window should be left undraped, and Frances would depend almost entirely on candles for light. The room was to be as warm, soft, and dark as possible. She bought or borrowed expensive carpets and hangings, a bed of estate, fine sheets, and a rich counterpane. Her friend the late Lady Sussex had one of ermine bordered with cloth of gold for her lying-in, and, as the King's niece, Frances would have wanted nothing less. &nbsp; <br><br>The nineteen-year-old mother-to-be was the daughter of Henry's younger sister, Mary, Duchess of Suffolk, the widow of Louis XII and known commonly as the French Queen. Frances was, therefore, a granddaughter of Henry VII and referred to as the Lady Frances to indicate her status as such. The child of famously handsome parents, she was, unsurprisingly, attractive. The effigy that lies on her tomb at Westminster Abbey has a slender, elegant figure and under the gilded crown she wears, her features are regular and strong. Frances, however, was a conventional Tudor woman, as submissive to her father's choice of husband for her as she would later be to her husband's decisions. &nbsp;<br><br> Henry-or "Harry"-Grey, Marquess of Dorset, described as "young," "lusty," "well learned and a great wit," was only six months older than his wife. But the couple had been married for almost four years already. The contractual arrangements had been made on 24 March 1533, when Frances was fifteen and Dorset sixteen. Among commoners a woman was expected to be at least twenty before she married, and a man older, but of course these were no commoners. They came from a hereditary elite and were part of a ruthless political culture. The children of the nobility were political and financial assets to their families, and Frances's marriage to Dorset reflected this. Dorset came from an ancient line with titles including the baronies of Ferrers, Grey of Groby, Astley, Boneville, and Harrington. He also had royal connections. His grandfather, the 1st Marquess, was the son of Elizabeth Woodville, and therefore the half-brother of Henry VIII's royal mother, Elizabeth of York. This marked Dorset as a suitable match for Frances in terms of rank and wealth, but there were also good political reasons for Suffolk to want him as a son-in-law. &nbsp; <br><br>The period immediately before the arrangement of Frances's marriage had been a difficult one for her parents. The dislike with which Mary, Duchess of Suffolk, viewed her brother's then "beloved," Anne Boleyn, was well-known. It was said that women argued more bitterly about matters of rank than anything else, and certainly Frances's royal mother had deeply resented being required to give precedence to a commoner like Anne. For years the duke and duchess had done their best to destroy the King's affection for his mistress, but in the end without success. The King, convinced that Anne would give him the son that Catherine of Aragon had failed to produce, had married her that January and she was due to be crowned in May/June. It seemed that the days when the Suffolks had basked in the King's favor could be over, but a marriage of Frances to Harry Dorset offered a possible lifeline, a way into the Boleyn camp. Harry Dorset's father, Thomas Grey of Dorset, had been a witness for the King in his efforts to achieve an annulment of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. He had won his famous diamond-and-ruby badge of the Tudor rose at the jousting tournaments that had celebrated Catherine's betrothal to the King's late brother, Arthur, in 1501. In 1529, the year before Thomas Grey of Dorset died, he had offered evidence that this betrothal was consummated. It had helped support Henry's arguments that Catherine had been legally married to his brother and his own marriage to her was therefore incestuous. Anne Boleyn remained grateful to the family, and Harry Dorset was made a Knight of the Bath at her coronation. &nbsp;<br><br> From Harry's perspective, however, the marriage to Frances-concluded sometime between 28 July 1533 and 4 February 1534-also carried political and material advantages to his family. His grandfather, the 1st Marquess, may have been Henry VII's brother-in-law, but by marrying a princess of the blood he would be doing even better; and the fact that he had only the previous year refused the daughter of the Earl of Arundel may be an early mark of his ambition. Through Frances, any children they had would be linked by blood to all the power and spiritual mystery of the crown. It was an asset of incalculable worth-though it would carry a terrible price. &nbsp; <br><br>Nearly four years later, sometime before the end of May, 1537, Frances's child was to be born. Harry Grey of Dorset was in London that spring, and Frances would surely have been with him then at Dorset House, on the Strand. It was one of a number of large properties built by the nobility close to the new royal palace of Whitehall. There was a paved street behind and, in front-where the house had its grandest aspect-there was a garden down to the river with a water gate onto the Thames. Traveling by boat in London was easier than navigating the narrow streets, and foreigners often commented on the beauty of the river. Swans swam among the great barges while pennants flew from the pretty gilded cupolas of the Tower. But there were also many grim sights on the river that spring. London Bridge was festooned with the decapitated heads of the leaders of the recent rebellion in the north, the Pilgrimage of Grace: men who had fought for the faith of their ancestors and the right of the Princess Mary to inherit her father's crown. For all Henry's concerns about the decorum of female rule, the majority of his ordinary subjects had little objection to the concept. That women were inferior as a sex was regarded as indisputable, but it was possible for some to be regarded as exceptional. The English were famous in Europe for their devotion to the Virgin Mary, the second Eve, who alone among humanity was born without the taint of the first sin, and who reigned under God as Queen of Heaven. It did not seem, to them, a huge leap to accept a Queen on Earth. Just as the Princess Mary's rights were under attack, however, so were their religious beliefs and traditions. &nbsp; <br><br>When the Pope had refused to annul Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, the King had broken with Rome, and the Pope's right of intervention on spiritual affairs in England had been abolished by an act of Parliament on 7 April 1533. With the benefit of hindsight we understand that this was a definitive moment in the history of the English-speaking world, but at the time, most people had seen these events as no more than moves in a political game. Matters of jurisdiction between King and Pope were not things with which ordinary people concerned themselves, and the aspects of traditional belief that first came under attack were often controversial ones. Long before Henry's reformation in religion there had been debate for reform within the Catholic Church, inspired in particular by the so-called Humanists. They were fascinated by the rediscovered ancient texts of Greece and Rome, and in recent decades Western academics had, for the first time, learnt Greek as well as Latin. This allowed them to read earlier versions of the Bible than the medieval Latin translations, and to make new translations. As a change in meaning to a few words could question centuries of religious teaching, so a new importance came to be placed on historical accuracy and authenticity. Questions were raised about such traditions as the cult of relics, and the shrines to local saints whose origins may have lain with the pagan gods. It was only in 1535, when two leading Humanists, Henry's former Lord Chancellor, Thomas More, and the Bishop of Rochester, John Fisher, went to the block rather than accept the King's claimed "royal supremacy" over religious affairs, that people began to realize there was more to Henry's reformation than political argument and an attempt to reform religious abuses. And even then many did not waver in their Catholic faith. These "Henrician" Catholics included among their number the chief ideologue of the "royal supremacy," the Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner. For the bishop, as for the King, papal jurisdiction, the abolished shrines, pilgrimages, and monasteries, were not intrinsic to Catholic beliefs, but the Holy Sacraments, such as the Mass, remained inviolate. Bishop and King argued that although the English Church was in schism in the sense that it had separated from Rome, it was not heretical and in opposition to it. &nbsp; <br><br>Those who disagreed, and opposed Henry's reformation, felt his tyranny to full effect, as the heads displayed at London Bridge and other public sites bore silent witness. One hundred and forty-four rebels from the Pilgrimage of Grace were dismembered and their body parts put on show in the north and around the capital. Even if Londoners avoided the terrible spectacle of these remains, they would not miss the other physical evidence of the King's reformation. Everywhere the great religious buildings that had played a central role in London life were being destroyed or adapted to secular use. Only that May, the monks from the London Charterhouse who had refused to sign an oath to the royal supremacy were taken to Newgate Prison, where they would starve to death in chains. &nbsp; Inside Frances's specially prepared chamber at Dorset House, however, the sights, sounds, and horrors of the outside world were all shut out. She was surrounded only with the women who would help deliver her baby. When the first intense ache of labor came it was a familiar one. Frances had already lost at least one child, a son who died in infancy, as so many Tudor children did. Nothing is recorded of his short life save his name: Henry, Lord Harington. Contemporary sources focus instead on the children born to Anne Boleyn: her daughter, Elizabeth, born on 7 September 1533 (at whose christening Dorset had borne the gilded saltcellar),* and the miscarriages that had followed-the little deaths that had marked the way to Boleyn's own, executed on trumped-up charges of adultery on 19 May 1536. The King's second marriage was annulled and an act of Parliament had since declared both the King's daughters, Elizabeth and Mary, illegitimate and incapable of succession. This raised in importance the heirs of the King's sisters in the line of succession, and both King and kingdom had already shown sensitivity to the implications. The rebels of the Pilgrimage of Grace had expressed their fear that on Henry's death England would pass to the foreigner James V of Scots, the son of his elder sister, Margaret. Meanwhile, her daughter by a second marriage, to the Earl of Angus, Lady Margaret Douglas, a favorite of the English court, was currently in prison for having become betrothed without the King's permission. Her lover, Anne Boleyn's uncle Thomas Howard, would die in the Tower that October. But while Frances's child would, inevitably, hold an important place within the royal family, the King remained determined that his own line would succeed him. The pressure on her to produce a male heir was therefore of a different order to that placed on Henry's wives. Dorset wanted a son, as all noblemen did, but he and Frances were still young and, when a girl was born, their relief that she was strong and healthy would have outweighed any disappointment in her sex. &nbsp; A servant carried the newborn child immediately to a nearby room and handed her to a nurse. It was usual for fathers to be at hand when their children were born and Dorset would have been one of the first to visit the dimly lit nursery where his daughter was being fed and bound in swaddling, to keep her limbs straight and prevent her from scratching her face. Her spiritual welfare was of still greater concern to her parents and her christening was arranged as soon as possible, though this meant Frances could not attend. New mothers were expected to remain in bed for up to a month, and some did not even sit up for a fortnight. Frances played a role, however, in helping choose as her daughter's godmother the King's new wife, Jane Seymour, after whom the little girl was named. &nbsp; With her pursed lips and sandy eyelashes, Jane Seymour seems a poor replacement for Anne Boleyn, whose black eyes, it was said, "could read the secrets of a man's heart," but like her predecessor, Jane Seymour was a ruthless seductress. Her betrothal to Henry was announced only the day after Anne was executed. Having gotten her king it was her performance as a broodmare that was now important. In this too, however, she was showing marked success. A pregnancy had been evident for weeks, and on 27 May the rumors were confirmed with a Te Deum sung at St. Paul's Cathedral "for joy of the Queen's quickening with child." It remained to be seen whether Jane Seymour would give the King the son he wanted, but in choosing her as godmother to their new daughter, Frances and Harry Dorset had offered a vote of confidence, and although they could not know it, the Seymour family would remain closely linked to their own, one way or another, thereafter. &nbsp; <br><br>About a fortnight after the christening, Frances had her first day out of bed and dressed in one of her finest nightgowns for a celebratory party. The royal tailor advised damask or satin, worn with an ermine-trimmed bonnet and waistcoat, allowing the wearer to keep warm as well as look good, for visiting female friends and relations. Frances had a younger sister, Eleanor, married to Lord Clifford, and an equally young stepmother. Frances's mother had died on Midsummer's Day in 1533, and her father had wasted little time before remarrying. The bride he had chosen was his fourteen-year-old ward, an heiress, Katherine Willoughby. He was then forty-nine, and the muscles of the champion jouster, like those of his friend the King, had begun to turn to fat. Frances would doubtless have wished her father had waited longer and made a different choice: the new Duchess of Suffolk had been raised alongside her like a sister since the age of seven. But Frances had accepted what she could not change and remained close to her childhood friend, who was now pregnant with the second of Frances's half brothers, Charles Brandon. After the party was over, Frances could venture beyond her chambers to the nursery and other rooms in the house, until the lying-in concluded at last when Jane was about a month old with the "churching"-a religious service of thanksgiving and purification that ended with Frances being sprinkled with holy water. "Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean," she prayed, "wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow."&nbsp;</p><h2>Fighting for Your Prophetic Promises: Receiving, Testing And Releasing A Prophetic Word</h2><p>Many Christians who receive a prophetic message, or "word," from the Lord don't understand that its fulfillment is not necessarily automatic. Others don't know how to determine if a prophetic word really is from the Lord. And still others don't understand what prophetic ministry is and how it works.<br><br>A veteran prophetic warrior, Barbara Wentroble is aware of the need for training in Bible-based prophetic ministry. With insight and wisdom, she explains not only how prophetic ministry works, but also how believers today--like biblical characters of old--may need to engage in spiritual warfare in order to receive promises that really are from God. Wentroble shows that prophetic words are not confined to church walls, and are not for a select few Christians but for all. She gives readers the guidelines and prophetic etiquette they need to help prevent abuse and misunderstanding, while helping them find the incredible blessing of the biblical gift of prophecy.</p><p>What exactly is prophetic ministry?<br>I received a prophetic word--now what?<br>Is it possible that I could have a prophetic gifting?<br>Will everything I hear be from the Lord?<br>Why hasn't the "word" I received been fulfilled yet?<br>How does spiritual warfare relate to the prophetic?<br>Do I have to receive a word in church for it to "count"?<br><br>Prophecy and prophetic ministry are complicated topics.

He has worked in a French factory and a West Virginia coal mine, and was a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal. His play, Rose, was produced off Broadway last year. He lives in Palm Beach, Florida, and Washington, D.C., with his wife, Vesna Obradovic Leamer. </p>The King of the Night--the entertainer adored by millions of devotees of The Tonight Show --is Killjoy of the Day, according to Leamer ( As Time Goes By , etc.) who in this lively unauthorized biography depicts "the most uptight, nervous guy you'll ever want to meet." Almost every aspect of John William Carson's life is shown to be different from the way it publicly appears to be: "the great host" is a reclusive man who rarely invites anyone to his home; "the loving husband" seeks solace outside his marriage; "the caring father" lacks rapport with his three sons. He is the sun and everything rotates around him, yet when the camera is off, "Johnny seems diminished, washed out." He does not praise his employees; silence is his highest accolade. To this workaholic who dreads vacations, The Tonight Show is everything. But to those whose livelihood depends on him--including three former wives--the man who has been seen "by more people on more occasions than anyone in American history"--the man who insists on privacy for himself, and who becomes belligerent and obnoxious when he gets drunk--is cold, uncomfortable and isolated.

Film-makers didn&#39;t just move to southern California for its sunny weather, they went West to evade the patent laws restricting the use of movie cameras. From its earliest days, Hollywood, the home of fantasy, created a hothouse of excess - too much money, too much adulation, too much expectation and too much ego. Some actors would trade sex in the, often vain, hope of career advancement, mobsters muscled in on the unions and extorted the studios, while the accountants appear to be among Hollywood&#39;s most creative people, managing to ensure that even the Star Wars films haven&#39;t yet shown a profit. But while stars have always been indulged, once their moment in the limelight has passed, their fall can be cruel. From the setting up of the studios by the movie moguls to the corporations that run them today, from drug addictions to McCarthy-era witch-hunts to the Mob, Dark History of Hollywood is the story of sex and excess, murder and suicide, ambition and betrayal, and how money can make almost everyone compromise. Intensively researched and superbly entertaining, Dark History of Hollywood reveals that the stories behind the silver screen are at least as gripping as many of those on it.</p><p></p><h2>I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It</h2><p>Charles Barkley has never been shy about expressing his opinions. Michael Jordan once said that we all want to say the things that Barkley says, but we don&#x2019;t dare. But even die-hard followers of the all-time NBA great, the star of TNT&#x2019;s<i> Inside the NBA</i> and CNN&#x2019;s <i>TalkBack Live</i>, will be astonished by just how candid and provocative he is in this book&#x2014;and just how big his ambitions are. Though he addresses weighty issues with a light touch and prefers to stir people to think by making them laugh, there&#x2019;s nothing Charles Barkley shies away from here&#x2014;not race, not class, not big money, not scandal, not politics, not personalities, nothing. &#x201c;Early on,&#x201d; says <i>Washington Post </i>columnist and ESPN talk show host Michael Wilbon in his Introduction, &#x201c;Barkley made his peace with mixing it up, and decided the consequences were very much worth it to him.

Why did families such as Anne Frank&#39;s get turned in? Investigative journalist Ad van Liempt pulls back the curtain on the shocking practice of Dutch bounty hunters of the Jews, and reveals that ordinary citizens were prepared to turn over their Jewish countrymen in exchange for cash.Van Liempt examines in great detail the careers of bounty hunters and describes some particularly horrifying cases. The most gripping are those involving young children. In one case, two bounty hunters traveled hundreds of miles to get their hands on a two-year-old girl living in a safe house; a month later she was gassed at Sobibor. In court, the bounty hunters consistently maintained that they received no premiums for their work, but the author shows the opposite to be true and traces the money involved.This haunting book uncovers a facet of the Holocaust that has previously been largely neglected and brings to light the day-to-day workings of the persecution of the Jews.</p><p>Ad van Liempt is a journalist and the author of several books. Translated from the German by S.J.

This unbalanced pattern of consumption makes it possible for foreign governments, corrupt political leaders, terrorist organizations and oil conglomerates to hold the economy and the citizens of the United States in a virtual stranglehold. There is no greater proof of this than the direct relationship between skyrocketing gas prices and the explosion of wealth among those who control the world's supply of oil.&nbsp;In Black Gold Stranglehold, Jerome R.

This extremely unbalanced pattern of consumption makes it possible for foreign governments, corrupt political leaders, terrorist organizations, and oil conglomerates to place the citizens of the United States in a stranglehold of supply and demand. There is no greater proof of this than the direct relationship between skyrocketing gas prices and the exploding wealth of those who control the supply of oil. <p>In <i>Black Gold Stranglehold</i>, Jerome R. Corsi and Craig R. Smith expose the fraudulent science that has been sold to the American people in order to enslave them: the belief that oil is a fossil fuel and a finite resource. On the contrary, this book presents authoritative research, currently known mostly in the scientific community, that oil is not a product of decaying dinosaurs and prehistoric forests. Rather, it is a natural product of the earth. The scientific evidence cited by Corsi and Smith suggests that oil is constantly being produced by the earth, far below the planet's surface, and that it is brought to attainable depths by the centrifugal forces of the earth's rotation. </p><p>In great detail Corsi and Smith explore the international and domestic politics of oil production and consumption. This includes the wealth and power of major oil conglomerates, the manipulation of world economies by oil-producing states and rogue terrorist regimes, and the political agenda of radical environmentalists and conservationists who obstruct the use of oil reserves currently controlled by the U.S. government. The authors offer an understanding of the dangerous situation America faces because its currency is no longer tied to any precious and truly scarce metals such as gold, as it was until 1973. This situation could easily lead to the devastation of the U.S. economy if Middle Eastern countries are able to enact current plans to accept only the Euro or gold-backed currencies such as the Gold Dinar instead of the U.S. dollar as the standard currency for oil. </p><p><i>Black Gold Stranglehold</i> will dramatically change the debate about oil. The significance of its message is sure to cause thoughtful people to reconsider the current dependence of the U.S. economy on imported oil.</p></p><h2>The Soccer Shoe Clue (Nancy Drew Notebooks #5)</h2><p><b>Kick!

S. Lewis (who called Barfield &#34;the best and wisest of my unofficial teachers&#34;) and J. R. R. Tolkien (on whom Barfield&#39;s book Poetic Diction had an appreciable impact). Often called a Christian thinker, Barfield argued for a holistic approach to language and reality-an approach at odds with the reductionist, atomistic views prevalent in Oxbridge intellectual circles at the time. History in English Words (1926), Barfield&#39;s first nonfiction book, seeks to discover the evolution of consciousness in Western civilization by exploring the change in meanings of various Indo-Aryan words as used in the British Isles in particular. Barfield&#39;s history in words, illustrated throughout by common English terms, is a pathway to discovering our humanity. &#34;In our language alone,&#34; he writes, &#34;not to speak of its many companions, the past history of humanity is spread out in an imperishable map, just as the history of mineral earth lies embedded in layers of its outer crust. . . .Language has preserved for us the inner, living history of our soul.&#34; Barfield&#39;s purpose is not to break down language into its smallest parts in order to facilitate daily communication. It is to understand words as speech-the common property of humans-that reveals the mind and allows for the deeper communication that underlies all human activity.</p><p></p><h2>The Year&#39;s Best Science Fiction : Sixteenth Annual Collection</h2><p>Collects short stories exploring themes of time and space travel, self-discovery, and science and technology.</p><p>Gardner Dozois once again proves himself to be among the best editors in science fiction with <i>The Year's Best Science Fiction Sixteenth Annual Collection</i>. Whether you like your SF hard or soft, with a twist or straight, you'll find something to love in here. Dozois picked perfect 1998 stories from the likes of Greg Egan, Bruce Sterling, and Ursula K. Le Guin for celebrity sparkle, but he didn't overlook relative newcomers either. It's hard to pick favorites from such a varied and delightful bunch. Paul J. McAuley's "Sea Change, with Monsters" is a thriller taking place in the icy seas of Europa, where genetically engineered weapon-creatures battle humans for survival. Cory Doctorow weighs in with the funny and poignant "Craphound," a tale of two secondhand junk entrepreneurs who find out that the love of good kitsch transcends all barriers. Liz Williams's "Voivodoi" explores one family's anguish and triumph in an Eastern Europe scarred by mutagens. And as usual, Dozois provides a stylish wrap-up of the previous year in science fiction, fantasy, and horror publishing. It speaks well for the health of the genre that Dozois picked these winners from hundreds of stellar nominees (he lists them in the back). And it's a rare treat to enjoy every single story in a collection. <i>--Therese Littleton</i>Praise for previous volumes of <i>The Year's Best Science Fiction</i>:<p> "Intelligent, wide-ranging (several of the stories here have not previously been published in the United States) and unfailingly literate, Dozois's volume is exemplary. . . . Anyone interested in contemporary short SF should own this volume" --Gregory Feeley, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p> "All of the stories in the collection are thought-provoking and well-written, succeeding on their own as stories quite apart from the genre label." --Kathryn Lance, <i>Arizona Daily Star</i></p><p> "This anthology represents contemporary SF at its very best. . . . There's little doubt that Dozois is to the 1980s and 1990s what John W. Campbell Jr., was to the 1940s and 1950s--the finest editor in the world of short SF." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "For anyone interested in SF short stories, this is the best---indeed, the <i>only</i>--place to start." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>The Blue Flower</h2><p>[Read by Derek Perkins]<br><br> <b><i>The Blue Flower</i></b> is set in the age of Goethe, in the small towns and great universities of late eighteenth-century Germany. It tells the true story of Friedrich von Hardenberg, a passionate, impetuous student of philosophy who will later gain fame as the romantic poet Novalis. Fritz seeks his father's permission to wed his ''heart's heart,'' his ''spirit's guide'' -- a plain, simple child named Sophie von K�hn. It is an attachment that shocks his family and friends. Their brilliant young Fritz, betrothed to a twelve-year-old dullard? How can this be?<br><br> The irrationality of love, the transfiguration of the commonplace, the clarity of purpose that comes with knowing one's own fate -- these are the themes of this beguiling novel, themes treated with a mix of wit, grace, and mischievous humor.<br><br></p><p>Penelope Fitzgerald wrote her first novel 20 years ago, at the age of 59. Since then, she's written eight more, three of which have been short-listed for England's prestigious Booker Prize, and one of which, <i>Offshore,</i> won. Now she's back with her tenth and best book so far, <i>The Blue Flower</i>. This is the story of Friedrich von Hardenberg--Fritz, to his intimates--a young man of the late 18th century who is destined to become one of Germany's great romantic poets. In just over 200 pages, Fitzgerald creates a complete world of family, friends and lovers, but also an exhilarating evocation of the romantic era in all its political turmoil, intellectual voracity, and moral ambiguity. A profound exploration of genius, <i>The Blue Flower</i> is also a charming, wry, and witty look at domestic life. Fritz's family--his eccentric father and high-strung mother; his loving sister, Sidonie; and brothers Erasmus, Karl, and the preternaturally intelligent baby of the family, referred to always as the Bernhard--are limned in deft, sure strokes, and it is in his interactions with them that the ephemeral quality of genius becomes most tangible. Even his unlikely love affair with young Sophie von K�hn makes perfect sense as Penelope Fitzgerald imagines it. <p> <i>The Blue Flower</i> is a magical book--funny, sad, and deeply moving. In Fritz Fitzgerald has discovered a perfect character through whom to explore the meaning of love, poetry, life, and loss. In <i>The Blue Flower</i> readers will find a work of fine prose, fierce intelligence, and perceptive characterization.</p>Mariner paperback, 1997, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0-395-85997-1</p><h2>The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep A New Way of Getting Children to Sleep</h2><p><strong> Do you struggle with getting your child to fall asleep? </strong><br> In <i> The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep </i> you will follow Roger The Rabbit when he gets help from Uncle Yawn and other friends to fall asleep in the evening.

Also via the really sleep-inducing bedtime story, <i> The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep. </i> <br>PreS-Gr 2&#x2014;Roger the Rabbit cannot fall asleep. His father has nodded off, as have his siblings. His mother suggests that she and Roger take a walk to visit Uncle Yawn, "who was the world's kindest wizard and who lived just on the other side of the meadow." Written with a specific language pattern based on psychological techniques, this rather verbose picture book offers harried and desperate parents the promise of a magical story that will soothe their children to sleep, while offering relaxation and mindfulness techniques to help children take control of their thoughts and prepare for slumber. The artwork is mediocre and does not enhance the text. But according to the author's note in the front of the book, the artwork matters little; Ehrlin tells parents that "it is best if the child is lying down while listening, instead of looking at the pictures, so that he or she can relax even more." Ultimately, the book is instructional and didactic, specifically written for children who experience great difficulty winding down at the end of the day. VERDICT Most people should stick with the bedtime classics that soothe and calm, such as Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, Mem Fox's Time for Bed, or Peggy Rathman's Goodnight Gorilla.&#x2014;Lisa Kropp, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY</p><h2>Animations of mortality</h2><p>An abrasive and smug narrator--Brian the Badger--exposes the artful dodges and devices and the entrepreneurial ruthlessness essential for an aspiring animator on the path to fame and fortune</p><p></p><h2>The Norman Podhoretz Reader: A Selection of His Writings from the 1950s through the 1990s</h2><p>Organized by decade, an anthology of writings, ranging from the 1950s through the 1990s, by the author of The Prophets brings together more than twenty-five essays, political articles, book excerpts, and literary profiles on such topics as the Cold War, Huckleberry Finn, Simone de Beauvoir, Norman Mailer, and Lolita. 20,000 first printing.</p><p>Norman Podhoretz was editor-in-chief of Commentary for thirty-five years and is now the magazine&#39;s editor-at-large.Norman Podhoretz used to say, "One of the longest journeys in the world is the journey from Brooklyn to Manhattan." Podhoretz's journey to become one of America's most prominent intellectuals is remarkable: from Brownsville, Brooklyn, where he was the son of immigrant Jews, to Columbia University, Cambridge and finally, the editorship of the important intellectual journal Commentary. During the past five decades, Podhoretz has produced notable books and essays on a variety of topics including literature, politics, Jewish thought and culture. This reader brings together a collection of these essays and book excerpts, tracking Podhoretz's journey from young literary critic in the '50s ("The Adventures of Saul Bellow") to leading provocative thinker in the '60s ("My Negro Problem-and Ours") to prominent and influential neoconservative in later decades ("From Breaking Ranks: Prologue: A Letter to My Son"). Whether he writes about Saul Bellow, Vietnam or Larry Flynt, Podhoretz produces essays that share a common strand: in addition to their general perspicacity and good writing, they are highly personal. Not only do these essays reflect the ideas of the time in which they were written but they also illustrate how those ideas have affected Podhoretz as a thinking person and as a human being. To confine Podhoretz, as many do, to a political camp is to misunderstand the man and his intellectual journey. While faithful conservatives will certainly appreciate this collection, anyone who is interested in reading or writing about ideas in a way that is meaningful should consider reading at least a sampling of Podhoretz's work. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We think about them every day. How could we not know them? We learned them by heart before we came here, and they&#x2019;ve been drilled into our heads by constant use ever since.<br><br>But still we sit, nearly a thousand of us, on plastic benches in a former Pentecostal church (desanctified in the 1990s, I don&#x2019;t know why) listening to our twelve inviolate rules recited over a crackling PA system by nervous community members in their best clothes.<br><br>Because it&#x2019;s what we do. We do it every year to commemorate the extraordinary trip we all took together four years ago: our escape from fear and sickness and hunger, our miraculous arrival in this land of milk and honey. It&#x2019;s a trip that almost certainly had never happened before and, based on the state of the world when we left it, will never happen again. So April 23 is kind of like our Thanksgiving, but without the turkey and pumpkin pie. It is also, coincidentally, the day Shakespeare was born. And died.<br><br>We do it because it&#x2019;s easy to forget amid all the sweetness and fatness of this place that we don&#x2019;t belong here, that we pose a danger to it. That&#x2019;s why the rules are critical and the consequences of forgetting them are grave. It&#x2019;s like any strict religious or political system. When your practices are hard to follow, you&#x2019;d better keep reminding your flock of them.<br><br>I put my feet flat on the floor as the projector hums to action at the back of the hall, cutting a beam through the dark air and slowly illuminating the first face on the wide screen that hangs behind the old altar. It takes a moment for the shadows and shapes to become a person, to become someone I know or don&#x2019;t know. It&#x2019;s hard to watch this, but they always do it: as we recite the rules they show the faces of the people we lost since the last time we met here. It&#x2019;s like the &#x201c;in memoriam&#x201d; tribute you see on the Academy Awards or the Grammys, but also . . . it&#x2019;s not. This year there are seven of them. There&#x2019;s no explanation or commentary. They just scroll through these faces again and again. But most of us have a sense of the story behind each face. We understand, without saying so, the overrepresentation of the fragile, the wayward and the incompliant members of our community up there on that screen.<br><br>My mother glances at me as Dr. Strauss stands up from the dais at the front to recite the first rule, the one about allegiance.<br><br>The rules are never displayed, never even written down on a piece of paper. That&#x2019;s not how we do things. We&#x2019;ve gone back to an oral tradition.<br><br>I try to listen. I always do, but the words have been stirred around so many times they&#x2019;ve lost their particular order and shape in my ears. They&#x2019;ve melted and dissolved into a chaotic mix of impressions and anxieties.<br><br>Dr. Strauss is one of the leaders. There are nine of them and twelve counselors. The leaders make the policy and the counselors hand it down to us and translate it into our daily lives. We are each assigned to a counselor. Mine is Mr. Robert. He&#x2019;s sitting up there too.<br><br>A girl near the back in a green dress stands to recite the second rule, about the sequence of time. Heads politely turn.<br><br>It&#x2019;s an honor to get to recite one. Like landing a part in the Christmas pageant. I was chosen once, three years ago. My mom dressed me in her gold ballet flats and her most expensive silk scarf. She mashed rouge into my cheeks. I got to read the sixth one, about never submitting to medical attention outside the community.<br><br>After the girl speaks, we all turn back to the front, obediently awaiting rule number three.<br><br>The black-and-white face of Mrs. Branch now takes its turn up on the screen. She was an acquaintance of my mother&#x2019;s, and I know she died of breast cancer that barely got treated. The photo doesn&#x2019;t exactly hark back to happier times. It looks like it was taken on the day she got her diagnosis. I look away. Briefly I catch the eyes of my friend Katherine a few rows behind.<br><br>I find it&#x2019;s hard to figure out from watching the leaders fanned out on the dais which one of them is really in charge. No one will tell you, but I think I know. I think this because of something that happened to me when I was thirteen, not long before my turn at reciting the sixth rule.<br><br>It was around nine months after we&#x2019;d gotten here. I was still disoriented, still way too skinny, still watching TV to learn how to talk and act. I hadn&#x2019;t started going to school yet. I was having chronic breathing problems. My mom said it was really incredibly fortunate that somebody with asthma got to make the trip at all. She said something about my &#x201c;enhanced IQ&#x201d; making up for it, but barely. We tried to pretend it wasn&#x2019;t as bad as it was.<br><br>And then in February I caught a bad cold and it turned into pneumonia. My mother knew this almost certainly because she is an MD and keeps a stethoscope in her bathroom drawer. A couple of other members of our community&#x2019;s medical team came over. I was pretty whacked by that point. I was using an inhaler and they were pumping me full of antibiotics and steroids and God knows what else. There was an oxygen monitor clipped to my finger, and I know it was dipping too low. I struggled. My lungs couldn&#x2019;t take in enough air. It&#x2019;s a horrible feeling, in case you&#x2019;ve never had it.<br><br>By the second night it had gotten dire. I was completely out for some stretches, but I saw the look on my mother&#x2019;s face. She was shouting. She wanted to take me to a hospital. She said a simple ventilator for one night was all it would take to save my life. I guess we didn&#x2019;t have one in our community clinic then; we were still pretty new here. But putting me in a regular hospital wasn&#x2019;t something any of them would even consider because of the danger we pose to them, to regular people who were born here, who have different immunities than we do. And because what if, in taking my medical history or getting too close a look at my blood under a microscope, a doctor or a nurse started asking questions?<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need for her to die!&#x201d; I heard my mother crying from the next room. She was begging them, promising she would watch over everything, she wouldn&#x2019;t let anyone else care for me. No blood tests, no diagnostics. She would figure out a way to do it, to keep everything secret and safe.<br><br>Sometime later Mrs. Crew arrived. I could feel the mood shift in the house, even deep in my oxygen-poor brain. The screaming and cajoling stopped and there was just this lulling voice from the next room. For a few moments I was strangely alert, strangely cogent, listening as she calmly talked my mother down. &#x201c;After all we have sacrificed, Molly. After all we have been through . . .&#x201d; My mother left the room and I heard my counselor, Mr. Robert, talking to Mrs. Crew instead. I felt like I was listening to them from a perch on the ceiling, like I was already dead, as she coolly explained to him the procedure for dealing with my body, the issuance of a death certificate and the proper strategy for handling what remained of my identity in the state and federal databases. They had created our identities here; they could take them away. Finally she offered him some injection or pill or something like that. &#x201c;The angel of death,&#x201d; she called it in a low voice, to make my passing more comfortable. She assured him she would stay until it was over.<br><br>But it wasn&#x2019;t over. Sometime in the early morning my lungs started to open up a little. And by the end of the day a little more. And six weeks after that I was reciting the sixth rule in this very hall.<br><br>Mr. Botts, two rows behind me, stands up to recite the third rule, about not using our knowledge to change anything. I remember him from our early tutoring sessions. Mrs. Connor, with the thinning hair and in a weird orange tunic, takes up the fourth, which is kind of an extension of the third. I forget how I know her.<br><br>A guy named Mitch, who&#x2019;s a star because he goes to Yale, recites the fifth one, the secrecy rule. That may be the rule we think of most often. The leaders are obsessed with the minutiae of it, with us fitting in and never letting anything slip that might give us away. But at times I seriously wonder, if one of us did let something slip, could anybody ever guess where we are from? And if they did, could they possibly believe it?<br><br>The sixth and seventh rules, the ones about medical stuff, are recited by two people I don&#x2019;t really know and who, like me, probably just barely survived those rules.<br><br>I zone out on rules eight through eleven because a purple bead pops off my shoe and I scan the floor for it without appearing to. I&#x2019;d frankly rather look anywhere than at the big screen up front, because for the finale they&#x2019;ve left up the photo of Aaron Green, and I suspect that&#x2019;s no coincidence. It&#x2019;s a heartbreaking picture of a confused and well-meaning fourteen-year-old who tripped over his lies so clumsily they stopped him from going to school in the middle of last year. His teacher went to his house to check on him, and two days later he drowned in the Housatonic River on a rafting trip with his dad and his uncle. There was no ambulance, no emergency room. Mr. Green quietly followed the protocol; he called the special number he was supposed to call.<br><br>I snap to attention for the twelfth rule. It is Mrs. Crew, the angel of death herself, who stands up to deliver it. She is about five feet tall and her hair looks like a cremini mushroom, but she still scares me. I swear she recites that rule staring directly at me.<br>1.

The ceremony has fallen on a Wednesday this year, so we&#x2019;ve taken a vacation day. We eat it on the Great Lawn and kill a couple of hours between the end of the ceremony and the beginning of the semiannual &#x201c;teen social.&#x201d; Because our spirits are so light after the Rules Ceremony, why not have a party?<br><br>It seems crazy, but that&#x2019;s what we do. The night of the ceremony everybody in our community between the ages of fifteen and eighteen gets together and tries to fall in love with each other over dumb music and soggy chicken fingers. Good luck with that.<br><br>Because if we&#x2019;re going to love at all, or even like or lust, we have to do it with each other. See rule twelve. And it&#x2019;s not just for our own safety, as the counselors are quick to point out. It&#x2019;s for the health and safety of the people outside our community too. It&#x2019;s not something you can even joke about. Not that we joke about so many things.<br><br>At the park it&#x2019;s me, Katherine, Jeffrey Boland, Juliet Kerr, Dexter Harvey and a few others who go to school in Rockland County. Jeffrey falls asleep in the sunshine, Dexter puts on his headphones, and Katherine and I go for a walk around the reservoir.<br><br>&#x201c;So hard to see Aaron&#x2019;s face up there on the screen,&#x201d; I say slowly, glancing at the side of Katherine&#x2019;s face as we walk. I see the color blooming in her nearly transparent skin.<br><br>Aaron lived around the corner from her. He had a little dog, a pug mix or something, named Paradox, that used to run to Katherine&#x2019;s house every chance it got. Katherine worried about Aaron. It was harder for him than for most of the rest of us. Maybe I worried too. Katherine gave Aaron her old Mongoose BMX bike, and you always saw him riding around on it.<br><br>I know how sensitive Katherine is, and I know she&#x2019;ll hide everything she can, but I want to say something. I want to say at least one true thing.<br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t much of a swimmer. He never was,&#x201d; I add. It&#x2019;s a morbid point for me to make. I realize that, but Katherine looks relieved because it&#x2019;s my way of telling her that I&#x2019;m not trying to be too honest here. I&#x2019;m not trying to challenge anybody. I&#x2019;m accepting the story of Aaron&#x2019;s demise, as we all must, even though we know it is total bullshit.<br><br>She smiles a tiny bit. I can see the tears welling in her eyes.

He is the coauthor of Facts On File&#39;s Encyclopedia of Exploration, a Booklist/RBB &#34;Editors&#39; Choice Reference Source, 2004&#34; and a Library Journal &#34;Best Reference Source, 2004.&#34; He lives in New York.This revision of a 1985 title provides "a series of overviews for understanding the challenging subject of the American Indian, and a framework or frameworks for pursuing further historical and cultural studies." Text is accompanied by 110 black-and-white maps. According to the preface, maps are a useful way to convey Indian-related information both because of "the great" number of tribes and their movement over the centuries" and because "one's homeland is at the heart of the Native American worldview." Among the changes from the earlier edition are redrawn maps, 16 new maps (for example, "The Territory of Nunavut"), updated language (e.g., <i>Inuit </i> rather than <i>Eskimo</i> ), a new glossary, an expanded bibliography, and revised lists of tribal groups and museums. Content is arranged in seven chapters, including "Ancient Indians," "Indian Lifeways," and "Contemporary Indians." The largest single section, "Indian Wars," covers the early conflicts of the Arawal (1492) through the Canadian Indian Wars in the 1870s. Each chapter is broken down into sections discussing culture, events, tribes, and individuals. Appendixes provide a chronology of prehistory and history; listings of Indian Nations; Indian place-names; and a directory of museums, historical societies, and archaeological sites. A glossary, bibliography, and index complete the volume. Canadian coverage is better than in many similar works. Several chapters have sections specific to Canada, an appendix is devoted to contemporary Canadian First Nations, and other appendixes include Canada in their listings. This book is recommended for collections needing general information, historical coverage, and material on the Canadian region. It is a good companion to Waldman's <i>Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes </i> [RBB Ap 1 00] and well suited for the academic or public library. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He traps the town and ravages the land with grisly executions and horrible mutations . . . until the people rise up in a final, desperate battle. From the author of Swan Song.</p><p>The "stinger" is an alien bounty hunter that remains ominously hidden for most of the book, but appears to be an enormous wicked mixture of centipede and scorpion. The bounty it's after is the "good guy" of the tale--a waif-like being who invades the mind of a small girl to make its presence known. They both arrive in a hot, desolate West Texas town surrounded by the alkali dust and sagebrush of a flatland between mountains. And the battle begins. An unpretentious horror novel with memorable imagery, <i>Stinger</i> is this reviewer's favorite of Robert McCammon's. It has appealing characters. It has feuding motorcycle gangs. It even has a bit of a <i>West Side Story</i> romance between Anglo guy and Hispanic girl. Sure, it's a B-movie romp, but McCammon is earnest--he doesn't play it for laughs. The action is scary and horrifying, making for a long, satisfying read.First published as a paperback original in 1988, Stinger remains one of Robert McCammon&#39;s wildest, most compelling creations. Both a furiously paced action novel and an affectionate tribute to the SF/Horror films of an earlier era, it is vintage McCammon, and a grand, often visceral entertainment.The story takes place during a single twenty-four hour period in Inferno, Texas. Inferno is a town in trouble, driven to the brink by racial tension, gang violence, and a collapsing economy. But things can always get worse, and they do so with astonishing speed when an unidentified spacecraft crash lands in the desert outside of town, followed by a second craft bearing the alien being who will soon be known as Stinger. Stinger is a kind of interstellar hunter on a mission he intends to complete, whatever the cost. He brings with him an endless array of technological marvels and an infinite capacity for destruction that threaten the existence of Inferno, its inhabitants, and the larger world beyond.Filled with a large cast of vividly realized characters and sporting some of the most memorably horrific imagery you will ever encounter, Stinger is an adrenaline-fueled narrative of the highest order, its classic, pulp fictional elements transformed and elevated by a master storyteller. The result is pure Robert McCammon, an engrossing, hugely enjoyable experience that is sure to stay with you for a very long time to come.</p><h2>Max&#39;s Story (Puppy Tales: A Dog&#39;s Purpose #4)</h2><p><p>Meet Max_a very special dog with a very important purpose. Here is another irresistible tale in the bestselling series for middle grade readers adapted from the New York Times and USA Today bestselling novel A Dog's Purpose and A Dog's Journey by W.

Includes adorable illustrations by Richard Cowdrey and a reading and discussion guide at the end of the book.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Remarkable Record of Job: The Ancient Wisdom, Scientific Accuracy, and Life-Changing Message of an Amazing Book</h2><p><p>Far from being an engaging fable, the account of Job in the bible is one of the most historically and scientifically accurate records of the ancient world. Perhaps the oldest book in the Bible, the book of Job touches on many subjects of science and history. This commentary on the controversial Book of Job is very different from most of the seminary and church teachings so prevalent today, for it attests to the historicity of a man named Job who understood at the end of his life that God cannot be ?figured out,? but He can most certainly be trusted. </p><p>150 Pages Trade Paperback</p></p><p>A prolific and influential scholar known to believers and skeptics alike as &#x201c;the father of modern creation science,&#x201d; Dr. Henry M. Morris truly was a man of science and a staunch man of God. He was even said to have set the terms of debate about evolution for the second half of the 20th century by one Pulitzer Prize-winning academician. Dr. Morris began his serious study of the Bible in the 1930s and authoring books in the 1940s, but it was his landmark work, co-authored with Dr. John Whitcomb, titled <i>The Genesis Flood</i> in 1961 that influenced generations to begin discovering the fallacies of evolution and the biblical truth of creation. <p> With over 60 books, founding and leading the Institute for Creation Research (ICR), Dr. Morris&#x2019; death in 2006 was a profound loss to millions. </p><p> Dr. Morris created a thriving legacy that continues to equip many Christians to be able to defend the accuracy and authority of Scripture today. The new <i>Henry Morris Study Bible</i> and other resources that he developed remain essential sources of knowledge and understanding for believers.</p></p><h2>The Revolutionary John Adams</h2><p>John Adams comes to vivid life for young readers in this addition to Harness&#39;s acclaimed presidential picture-biographies. Dynamic artwork and lively narrative create a warm, personable portrait of the stubborn man from Braintree, Massachusetts, whose passion for liberty spurred him on to extraordinary roles as a Founding Father, first Vice President, and second President of the United States. Through Adams&#39;s eyes, kids witness the tension-enflamed streets of Boston, the bickering Continental Congress, the complexities of waging the War for Independence, and the challenges of governing a new nation. Vivid quotes from both John and Abigail Adams provide great primary source material for school reports, and three illustrated maps show readers where key events took place.</p><p>Cheryl Harness is the author and/or illustrator of numerous children&#x2019;s books, including seven picture book biographies for National Geographic and the series Cheryl Harness Histories. She has a natural talent for making history fun for kids, injecting the "wow" factor into the lives of America&#x2019;s historical heroes and heroines. A multi-award winning author and illustrator, she lives in her historic hometown of Independence, MO. Visit Cheryl Harness at her Web site: www.cherylharness.com.Gr. 3-6. America's second president, John Adams, is often overlooked because he's sandwiched between George "the father of his country" Washington and the brilliant, multitalented Thomas Jefferson. Harness corrects that oversight in this concise, yet informative, offering that emphasizes Adams' public life and his important contributions to the establishment of the U.S. government. The oldest son of a shoemaker and farmer, Adams attended Harvard, taught school, and later became a lawyer. An active participant in colonial causes, he helped to write the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>, lobbied for France's assistance during the Revolution, authored the Massachusetts state constitution, and served as ambassador to England before becoming president. After leaving office he remained active as an elder statesman, debating and exchanging views with his archrival Jefferson until the day they both died, July 4, 1826. Harness' warm, friendly, mixed-media illustrations, which range from full-color, double-page spreads to labeled diagrams to black-line silhouettes, will delight children, and quotes from Adams' letters, including many letters to his wife, Abigail, are a bonus. A fascinating book for young history buffs, this will also be great for classes studying the struggle for independence; there's even an illustrated summary of world events during Adams' term of office. Pair this with Alexandra Wallner's <i>Abigail Adams</i> (2001), which looks at the other half of a dynamic couple. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Barclay's interpretation of the Gospel is full of wisdom, and it offers clear and captivating insight from beginning to end. Having picked up one section to study, the reader will find it difficult to stop reading until the whole volume is completed.</p><p>For almost fifty years and for millions of readers, the Daily Study Bible commentaries have been the ideal help for both devotional and serious Bible study.

But guerrilla war-fare is not just the tool of modern-day terrorists. Its roots stretch back to our very own revolution.</p><p>In <em>Violent Politics</em>, William Polk takes us on a concise, brilliant tour of insurgencies throughout history, starting with the American struggle for independence, when fighters had to battle against both the British and the loyalists, those colonists who sided with the monarchy. Instinctively, in a way they probably wouldn't have described as a coherent strategy, the rebel groups employed the tactics of insurgency.</p><p>From there, Polk explores the role of insurgency in several other notable conflicts, including the Spanish guerrilla war against Napoleon, the Irish struggle for independence, the Algerian War of National Independence, and Vietnam. He eventually lands at the present day, where the lessons of this history are needed more than ever as Americans engage in ongoing campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq&#x2014;and beyond.</p></p><p><p>William R.

Simultaneous.</p><p>Grade 3-6. Kai, a spirited and intelligent young girl, longs to become an artisan, but in 15th-century Yorubaland women are banned from such work. Risking punishment, Kai secretly watches craftsmen in a secluded courtyard and closely examines their fabulous brass sculptures, even smuggling some discarded pieces for further inspection. Only her closest friend, Aisha, knows of her secret wish. Life becomes even more complicated for Kai when her village is threatened by starvation after the yam crop is destroyed by blight. Inexplicably, the chief sends Kai and her beautiful, but lazy sister, Jamila, to deliver a message for help to a distant tribe. The two use their wits to survive a multitude of dangers before they can reach the tribe that can save their people. Kai's hope for the future is rekindled when she discovers that the women of this far-off village are skilled in casting brass sculptures. Well written, with a fast-moving plot, this story dramatizes the strength of African women, and the restricted but important roles they played in the everyday life of ancient Africa, a tradition that continues to this day.

Funny, insightful and real, the book became an international bestseller. &#34;A Parrot in a Pepper Tree&#34;, the sequel to &#34;Lemons&#34;, follows the lives of Chris, Ana and their daughter, Chloe, as they get to grips with a misanthropic parrot who joins their home, Spanish school life, neighbours in love, their amazement at Chris appearing on the bestseller lists . . and their shock at discovering that their beloved valley is once more under threat of a dam. &#34;A Parrot in the Pepper Tree&#34; also looks back on Chris Stewart&#39;s former life - the hard times shearing in midwinter Sweden (and driving across the frozen sea to reach island farms); his first taste of Spain, learning flamenco guitar as a 20-year old; and his illustrious music career, drumming for his schl band Genesis (sacked at 17, he never quite became Phil Collins), and then for a circus.</p><p>Chris Stewart prepared for life on a mountain farm in Spain with jobs of doubtful relevance. After leaving Genesis (he drummed on the first album), he joined a circus, learnt how to shear sheep, crewed a yacht in Greece, went to China for the Rough Guides, gained a pilot&#39;s license in Los Angeles, and completed a course in French cking. Despite the extraordinary success of his first two books, Chris, Ana and their daughter Chloee continue to live on their farm, with their numerous dogs, cats, chickens, sheep and one misanthropic parrot.It is everything that made the first book so hugely successful - endearing, heartwarming, self-deprecating, sometimes surreal. -- William Leith * Evening Standard * He's pulled it off: this is as funny and charming as the first book. -- Alasdair Palmer * Sunday Telegraph * A GIANT FOR 2002. The chapters I saw were wonderful. -- Sarah Broadhurst * The Bookseller * Chris Stewart's story cannot be told too often. * The Times * An unexpected gem of a book, written with a mix of insight and self-deprecation that echoes Bill Bryson at his funniest. * Dundee Evening Telegraph &amp; Post * Stewart never patronises, he just observes . . . funny, generous and warm . -- Sue Arnold * Guardian * A brilliant follow-up. * The Bookseller * Easily the best and funniest of all those otherwise wearisome expatriate diaries. * Independent on Sunday * All quite delightful and slips down as easily as a small bottle of Spanish Beer. -- Giles Foden * Conde Naste Traveller *</p><h2>J. S. Bach (Volume 2)</h2><p><p>Independent of his international renown as a humanitarian, Albert Schweitzer is well known as a great musicologist; a reputation that rests largely upon this book. Schweitzer's <i>J. S. Bach</i> is one of the great full-length studies of the composer, his life, and his work. Its influence on the subsequent performance of Bach's music was enormous, and there is scarcely a later work on Bach which does not acknowledge a deep debt to Schweitzer's. <i>Grove's Dictionary</i> says of the book, "Schweitzer has probably been more quoted than any authority since Spitta."<br>The first volume contains a virtual history of Protestant church music, examining the role of music in the early Protestant services of many European countries. Frequent allusions to the parallel development of art and poetry, to the leading philosophic and religious concepts of the time, and to events of contemporary history supplement and enrich the text. Narrowing the study to Germany, Schweitzer traces to their roots the forms used by Bach (with particular emphasis on the German chorale and the forms built around it), and assess the contributions of Sch�tz, Sheidt, Buxtehude, Pachelbel, and others of Bach's predecessors. The volume includes a full account of Bach's life, and discusses his works for organ, clavier, strings, and orchestra. Suggestions for performance include sections on bowing, on playing chords and double stops, and on the practice of ornamentation in Bach's time.<br>Volume&nbsp;Two is concerned with Bach's choral music &#x2014; the chorales, cantatas, the <i>Magnificat</i>, the <i>St. Matthew</i> and <i>St. John Passions</i>, the motets, songs, oratorios, and masses. The illuminating analysis of these works, illustrated by hundreds of musical examples, is dominated by Schweitzer's highly original theories regarding Bach's pictorial representation of the text in the music, and the expressive motives Schweitzer has found and identified throughout Bach's compositions. A long concluding chapter makes recommendations for performance on tempo, phrasing, accentuation, dynamics, and on the size and arrangement of the orchestra and choir.<br>Schweitzer's <i>J. S. Bach</i> is among the definitive reference works on Bach and is high on the list of required reading for music students. Yet it is not a difficult or formidable work. It offers a stimulating, well-written narrative, with much in it to interest the music lover as well as the scholar.</p><p></p></p><p>Albert Schweitzer (1875-1965) won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1952. While still a young man he demonstrated extraordinary abilities in a wide range of pursuits, including science, theology, and music. In 1908 he published his magisterial study of the life and works of Johann Sebastian Bach. He studied medicine from 1905 to 1913 at the University of Strasbourg, then founded a hospital in French Equatorial Africa, where he spent most of the remainder of his life. Schweitzer used his Nobel Prize stipend to expand the hospital and to build a leper colony. His bookThe Quest of the Historical Jesus is also available from Johns Hopkins.</p><h2>Through the Ages in Palestinian Archaeology: An Introductory Handbook</h2><p>The public&#x2019;s continuing fascination with Near Eastern archaeology has often been frustrated by highly technical and specialized studies.

Updated nutrition tables, as well as email and web addresses, further enhance the book� s sensible advice and gentle wit. The Sheep Book is organized according to the natural reproductive cycle of the ewe, leading the reader through a year in sheep� s life during which sheep and shepherd form a symbiosis. A good shepherd manages a flock so that its care and environment fits all stages of the annual journey from breeding through pregnancy, lambing, growing of lambs, marketing of lambs and wool, and the revitalization of the ewe for another cycle. Sheep are the ideal, useful domesticated animal,� writes Parker. They are hardy and healthy. Except for an occasional aggressive ram or uppity ewe they are gentle and submissive. They are small enough for a good-sized child or senior citizen to handle. They give both superlative meat and a fiber that has no peer. They are the ideal animal for the homestead, small farm, place in the country, suburban backyard, or any other place where man makes his home and grass will grow.� The Sheep Book is especially valuable for small and moderate-scale sheep raisers and those interested in growing wool for fiber arts. Enhanced and updated for the internet age, this classic book is a valuable companion for anyone who wants to raise sheep that are healthy and productive, and to do so by working in harmony with the natural instincts of sheep and the rhythms of the natural world.</p><p><b>Ron Parker</b> is an academic geologist who turned to sheep raising in 1976.

Beginner and veteran shepherds alike will appreciate the many how-to-do-it descriptions in these chapters. The reading is always interesting, always clear, and this book would be an asset in any shepherd&#x2019;s library.&#x201d;<br> Woody Lane, Ph.D., livestock nutritionist<br><br> The revised and updated The Sheep Book is what the literary critics would call a must read&#x2019; for beginning shepherds. For that matter the lists of sources for supplies, of web sites, of organizations, of breed associations, and of publications will be worth the price of the book to experienced shepherds. Ron&#x2019;s insistence from his first days as a sheep farmer on raising sheep outside on grass with no heavy equipment put him ahead of the low-tech, sustainable ag movement. His scientific background and his outside the box&#x2019; thinking make this a book of substance, significance, and originality without being the least bit pedantic.&#x201d;<br> Guy Flora, Editor, <i>The Shepherd</i></p><h2>Master of the Mountain</h2><p><p>When Rebecca's boyfriend talks her into vacationing at a mountain lodge with his swing club, she quickly learns she's not cut out for playing musical beds.

Utilizing a network of knowledgeable but offbeat friends, Brandstetter discovers that Streeter was about to disclose the whereabouts of the missing Interior Minister of the Central American country Los Inocente, General Cortez-Ortiz, a man so reknowned for his savagery that his nickname is El Carnicero, the Butcher.

When the younger man discovers an unknown painting in the attic, entitled "Killing Commendatore"--a painting that takes its cues from Mozart's opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>--he also discovers clues about Amada, his family and their involvement in a violent and failed plot to kill a Nazi leader in Vienna. As the painter slowly learns the truth, he is equally consumed by the story of a wealthy and mysterious neighbor, Menshiki, in what is, according to the author, a clear homage to <i>The Great Gatsby</i>. The painter becomes obsessed with Menshiki's doomed love affair, the young girl who might be his child and a stone-lined underground space in the nearby woods where Buddhist priests were once buried alive. This pit becomes a portal into another world, a surreal place where the figures from "Killing Commendatore" take form to guide our narrator on an epic journey. Ambitious and haunting, tactile and surreal, preoccupied with questions about trauma, art and the creative process, <i>Killing Commendatore</i> moves between the known world and a complex underworld.</p><p>HARUKI MURAKAMI was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo.

The novel will only burnish [Murakami's] reputation, barely rivalled since the days of Dickens, as the living novelist who best combines literary excellence and commercial popularity." &#x2014;<i>The Telegraph&nbsp;</i>(UK)<br><br>"Immersive, repetitive, big-hearted. . . . <i>Killing Commendatore</i> gets the balance right. Perhaps this lies in its exhilarating portrayal of how it feels to make art. In long, powerful passages, Murakami describes painting with the intensity of what seems like just-concealed autobiography."<i><i> &#x2014;The Washington Post<br></i></i><br>"The celebrated Japanese maverick keeps recombining his favourite idiosyncratic tropes to unexpectedly powerful effect. . . . <i>Killing Commendatore </i>is at times tense, creepy, absurdly funny, self-aware and baffling&#x2014;and engrossing throughout. Late Murakami by way of late David Lynch." &#x2014;<i>Maclean's</i><br><br>"At first glance,&nbsp;<i>Killing Commendatore</i>, Murakami's whopping new novel, seems like a return to the surreal after several smaller, more intimate, realistic works. It's not, though. And that blurring of the boundaries is one of the novel's many strengths. . . .&nbsp;<i>Killing Commendatore</i>&nbsp;is strongest in its quiet moments, rewarding a slow immersion." &#x2014;<i>Toronto Star</i><br><br>"Eccentric and intriguing,&nbsp;<i>Killing Commendatore</i>&nbsp;is the product of a singular imagination. . . . Murakami is a wiz at melding the mundane with the surreal. . . . He has a way of imbuing the supernatural with uncommon urgency. His placid narrative voice belies the utter strangeness of his plot. . . . The worldview of Murakami's novels is consistent, and it's invigorating. In this book and many that came before it, he urges us to embrace the unusual, accept the unpredictable." &#x2014;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"Some novelists hold a mirror up to the world and some, like Haruki Murakami, use the mirror as a portal to a universe hidden beyond it. . . . He builds his self-contained world deliberately and faithfully, developing intrigue and suspense and even taking care to give each chapter a cliffhanger ending as in an old-fashioned serialized novel. . . . When you're under Mr. Murakami's trance you're likely to keep flipping the pages." &#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>"Many of these themes are familiar in Murakami's work, but he continues to explore them with phenomenal energy and verve. And humour. What makes his voice so distinctive, and so captivating, is the mix of precise observation, clarity and deadpan humour. When it all seems to be going a bit too far, a flash of wit will remind us that this is a game, and we have been invited to play it. We are, in fact, in on the joke. . . . Murakami is a master storyteller and he knows how to keep us hooked." &#x2014;<i><i>The Times </i></i>(UK)<br><br>"Murakami is happy to exist in a state of flux. . . .

Murakami's 'Land of Metaphor' remains a country where wonders never cease." &#x2014;<i><i>The Financial Times<br></i></i></p><h2>Animal Tracks</h2><p>Introduces the tracks and signs left by various animals, including the raccoon, duck, frog, black bear, and human.</p><p>In this interactive parent-child book, Dorros ( Rain Forest Secrets ; Me and My Shadow ) brings hidden woodland animals up close by depicting their tracks--sure evidence of the presence of other creatures in our midst. Readers follow these tracks across watercolor landscapes, turn each page and find the culprit--a turtle dragging itself to a sunny rock, a porcupine heading for a bark breakfast. Although Dorros's approach admirably enlivens his subject, freeing it from frequently dry field-guide literature, his bland palette and somewhat listless text fail to convey the excitement children can feel on encountering tracks. The book is, however, instructive as an introduction to woodland-stream fauna, relative size of tracks and other signs of animal presence. Youngsters may be most intrigued by Dorros's demonstration of how to "trap" tracks by luring nocturnal animals to a flour-covered area.

This biophysical theory eventually developed into the concept of orgone (a word coined from the same root as "organism" and "orgasm"): which Reich saw as a massless, omnipresent substance, similar to luminiferous aether, but more closely associated with vital, living energy than inert matter. Orgone would coalesce and create organization on all scales, from the smallest microscopic units-called bions in orgone theory-to macroscopic structures like organisms, clouds, or even galaxies. Reich believed that many diseases, and particularly cancer, were caused by deficits or constrictions in the flow of orgone in the body, and developed specially designed "orgone accumulators" which supposedly charged the body with orgone collected from the atmosphere.<br><br> Reich created the Orgone Institute after immigrating to the US, and pursued research into orgone energy for more than a decade, publishing his own work through the institute and producing orgone accumulators and related devices for distribution. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) eventually obtained a federal injunction barring the interstate distribution of orgone-related materials, on the charge that Reich and his associates were making false and misleading claims. When Reich violated the injunction he was jailed, and all orgone-related equipment and literature owned by Reich and his associates were destroyed.</p><p></p><h2>Dooley: My 40 Years at Georgia</h2><p>Vince Dooley&#x2014;the player, the coach, the administrator, the legend&#x2014;is finally ready to tell his story. Georgia's prodigal son got his start on the rough end of Mobile, Alabama, where he used football as a springboard to an incredible life. After four decades, 201 wins, six SEC championships, and one national title, Dooley is ready to hang up his stirrups. In <i>Vince Dooley: My 40 Years at Georgia</i>, Dooley talks candidly to give the complete inside story of his extraordinary life and career.</p><p>"There are brain surgeons, rocket scientists, visionary statesmen, and military heroes who have had extraordinarily fulfilling and meaningful jobs, but my jobs as Georgia football coach and athletics director have undeniably been, in my opinion, the best jobs in the world." &#x2014;Vince Dooley <p>"For 41 years Vincent has served the University of Georgia well and has become one of the most respected people in his profession. This does not happen by accident." &#x2014;from the Foreword by Barbara Dooley</p>Over the span of four decades as a national championship football coach and an award-winning administrator, Vince Dooley made University of Georgia athletics his life&#x2019;s work. As his Hall of Fame career wound down he decided he was ready to tell his story as one of the most respected and decorated figures in the history of intercollegiate athletics. Dooley grew up on the rough end of Mobile, Alabama, and used football as his springboard to an incredibly fulfilling life. He was an outstanding defensive back who captained the 1953 Auburn team. He went on to join the Tigers coaching staff before landing the head job at Georgia in 1964 at the tender age of 31. In 25 years at the helm for Georgia, Dooley won 201 games, six SEC championships, and the 1980 national championship, for which he was named Coach of the Year. In 1979 he assumed the role of athletics director, a position he held concurrently until he retired from coaching in 1988. In that role he brought Georgia athletics back into the national spotlight and was considered one of the most successful administrators in the nation. He flourished there until 2004, when UGA president Michael Adams made the highly controversial decision not to renew his contract. In Dooley: My 40 Years at Georgia, the coach talks candidly for the first time about his final days at Georgia and gives his perspective on the behind-the-scenes negotiations. He also recounts everything that led to those final days, from his playing career to his surprise hiring at the age of 31, and from his relationships with all of his players and coaches over the years&#x2014;including the emergence of the 1980 national championship team&#x2014;to his dealings with the other legends of the sport, such as Bear Bryant, Woody Hayes, Bud Wilkinson, Shug Jordan, and so many more. Dooley is an insider&#x2019;s look at Georgia football and Georgia athletics over the past four decades from the man who lived it every day.</p><h2>Edible: An Adventure into the World of Eating Insects and the Last Great Hope to Save the Planet</h2><p><p>Insects. They&#x2019;re what&#x2019;s for dinner. Can you imagine a world in which that simple statement is not only true but in fact an unremarkable part of daily life? Daniella Martin, entomophagist and blogger, can. </p><p>In this rollicking excursion into the world of edible insects, Martin takes us to the front lines of the next big trend in the global food movement and shows us how insects just might be the key to solving world hunger. Along the way, we sample moth larvae tacos at the Don Bugito food cart in San Francisco, travel to Copenhagen to meet the experimental tasters at Noma&#x2019;s Nordic Food Lab, gawk at the insects stocked in the frozen food aisle at Thailand&#x2019;s Costco, and even crash an underground bug-eating club in Tokyo. </p><p>Martin argues that bugs have long been an important part of indigenous diets and cuisines around the world, and investigates our own culture&#x2019;s bias against their use as a food source. She shines a light on the cutting-edge research of Marcel Dicke and other scientists who are only now beginning to determine the nutritional makeup of insects and champion them as an efficient and sustainable food source. </p><p>Whether you love or hate bugs, Edible will radically change the way you think about the global food crisis and perhaps persuade you that insects are much more than a common pest. For the adventurous, the book includes an illustrated list of edible insects, recipes, and instructions on how to raise bugs at home.</p></p><p><p><b>DANIELLA MARTIN</b>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;certified entomophagist, or bug-eating expert. She has been featured in the <i>Huffington Post, The New Yorker,</i> the <i>Wall Streeet Journal, SF Weekly,</i> and AOL News.</p><p>www.girlmeetsbug.com</p><b>Introduction</b> <br>This book is about eating bugs. For real. And if you make it all the way through the book, you&#x2019;re going to want to taste the revolution for yourself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? Eating bugs makes sense&#x2014;ecological, nutritional, economic, global, and culinary sense. Yes, they even taste good. Many people disdainfully say they &#x201c;don&#x2019;t like bugs,&#x201d; are afraid of them, or are repelled by them on some deep, subconscious, yet stridently self-righteous level. But like them or not, insects are the largest terrestrial biomass on Earth. That means of all the animals that live on dry land, insects are most of them. If someone were to determine, by the numbers, what Earth was about, they would conclude: insects. Beetles, mostly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the fact that the planet you live on has more bugs on it than any other animal (I know, it&#x2019;s making your skin crawl just thinking about it). Insects were here before us, and they&#x2019;ll help us decompose after we die. People say money makes the world go round, which may be true within human society, but in nature, it&#x2019;s bugs. Bugs do the majority of the pollinating and decomposing, the real circle of life. And that&#x2019;s not to mention how important pollination is for the food we grow and eat. The bugs we love to hate&#x2014;like bees, wasps, and even mosquitoes&#x2014;all contribute to pollination, which helps begin life. Decomposition, largely performed by insects, dismantles it, making room for more life to flourish. And yet we tend to treat them as a whole as if they are worse than the garbage certain species help decompose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a large part of the reason I am so inspired by insects, why I&#x2019;ve spent nearly a decade thinking about them and studying them, and why I wrote this book. I truly believe we should all be eating bugs&#x2014;as our ancestors did, as our global neighbors do, as our primate cousins do, and as we ourselves do constantly, by accident, without realizing it.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#x2019;m not asking anyone to drastically change their diet, to give up foods they love, or to subscribe to some new overarching system. I&#x2019;m not even going to suggest substituting insects in place of other foods, per se. I&#x2019;m simply asking you to open your mind&#x2014;just a little&#x2014;to give bugs a chance and a place on your culinary palate. &nbsp; Whenever anyone finds out for the first time just what it is I do, the first thing they want to know is &#x201c;How did you get into <i>that</i>?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I ever ate a bug, on purpose, was in Oaxaca, Mexico. I was traveling on a student visa, studying pre-Columbian food and medicine for my BA in cultural anthropology. Mainly, I wanted to see what vestiges of early Mexican life had survived the Spanish conquistadors, and their relative extermination of native practices, into modern-day life. I&#x2019;d read about entomophagy&#x2014;insect eating&#x2014;in college, how the ancient Aztecs and Mayans ate everything that was available to them, including insects, rodents, and reptiles. If it moved, they ate it. And often to great success&#x2014;there were stories about how, during the right season, a person could wade into Lake Tenochtitlan the center of the Aztec world, with a couple of agave-fiber nets and come back with twenty to thirty pounds of larvae and other aquatic insects within a few hours. That might not sound so great to us, but when compared with the difficulties, dangers, and unreliability of hunting, it&#x2019;s a pretty darn awesome return on investment. That&#x2019;s a big load of high-quality protein, fats, mineral and vitamins for remarkably little effort, energy, and risk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew when I went to Mexico that I was definitely going to have to try edible insects for myself. It was also one of the few easily observable practices that was a clear holdover from earlier times. Certainly, there are many foods that remain as popular today in Mexico as they were when they were first cultivated and developed by the Aztecs: tortillas, tamales, beans, chiles. But the historic purity of many of these foods is somewhat diluted with modern ingredients, such as lard, and modern processing machines. Insects, however, are often eaten just as they were thousands of years ago: dried in the sun, toasted on a comal (a flat, earthenware cooking surface), or ground up in a <i>molcajete</i>, a mortar and pestle carved from volcanic rock, one of the world&#x2019;s oldest kitchen tools. In the cities, insects are generally deemed a delicacy (and their price reflects this), but in the countryside, where the majority of native people live, they are more a way of life. For me, this lent them a certain wholeness as an unbroken tie to the past&#x2014;and thus anthropologically interesting in terms of my goal of recording the modern life of ancient traditions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I saw a middle-aged woman, dressed in a brightly colored Mayan wrap, selling toasted grasshoppers in the Oaxaca city square, it was a no-brainer. I paid my 20 pesos and received a little paper bag of the brick-red bugs. I took my roasted grasshoppers, called <i>chapulines</i>, and sat down at a table in an outdoor caf�. I was definitely going to need something to wash this down with. I ordered a Coke and poured the <i>chapulines</i> out onto the white tablecloth, intending to take a cool photograph before sampling them. Just as I was getting ready to brave my first bite of bug, the strangest thing happened: Kids from the street, likely of Trique indigenous descent, made a beeline for me and began eating the <i>chapulines</i> right off my table&#x2014;without even asking! I hardly had time to grab a few for myself, as they gobbled them right up.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I&#x2019;ve thought about this in the years since it happened: Yes, the kids were likely hungry&#x2014;more than 70 percent of Oaxacans live in extreme poverty. These children spend their days begging tourists on the streets of the city while their parents sell various things in the market: <i>elotes</i>, a chili-spiced corn on the cob; indigenous crafts and trinkets; and, of course, toasted insects. The kids had probably seen lots of tourists buy a bag of <i>chapulines</i> &#x201c;for the experience,&#x201d; eat one or two, squinch up their faces, take a few photos, and throw the rest away. The kids must have supposed, &#x201c;Eh, she won&#x2019;t care, she&#x2019;s a tourist. Let&#x2019;s get &#x2019;em while the getting&#x2019;s good, while they&#x2019;re still crispy and we don&#x2019;t have to fish them out of the trash.&#x201d; On the one hand, it could be interpreted as a bit Dickensian; on the other, Cheetos are technically made of yuckier stuff than this.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I managed to taste a few <i>chapulines</i>, and I probably would have thrown the rest away. They tasted unfamiliar, sort of like a shriveled, spicy, slightly burned potato chip, but mostly, your mind gets in the way, telling you it won&#x2019;t be safe or good to eat too many. Heck, you might turn into a bug yourself (Dickens meets Kafka?). But there are lots of foods I love that others are slightly grossed out by: beef tongue, smelly fermented soybeans, tinned sardines and oysters, oily raw mackerel, and all manner of fish eggs. So why not bugs?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What struck me was that it seemed like the kids were eating them because they liked them. They genuinely wanted to eat them, just like American kids want to eat Cheetos.</p><h2>The Decline of the Californios: A Social History of the Spanish-Speaking Californians, 1846-1890</h2><p>In his enduring study of Spanish-speaking Californians--a group that includes both native-born Californians, or <i>Californios</i>, and immigrants from Mexico--Leonard Pitt charts one of the earliest chapters in the state's ethnic history, and, in the process, he sheds light on debates and tensions that continue to this day.

This was an exceptional period in the history of the jeweller&#39;s art, when the wealthy were gripped by a passion for display and recorded their favourite jewels in glittering portraits. This book surveys the making and wearing of jewellery from late medieval simplicity, through the full flowering of the art of the Renaissance goldsmith, to the emphasis on stones rather than settings in the reign of James I.</p><p></p><h2>Forgotten Truths</h2><p>Can the Lord come back before the elect are saved? This and many other questions are answered in Anderson&#39;s thought-provoking study.</p><p>Sir Robert Anderson (1841-1918) was converted to Christ at the age of nineteen and almost immediately began to preach in his native Dublin where he trained for a legal profession at Trinity College. He became a respected member of the Irish Home Office and an expert on criminal investigation. In 1888, he was summoned to Scotland Yard, London, to serve as Chief of the Criminal Investigation Department, an office he filled with distinction until retirement in 1896. At his retirement, he was knighted by Queen Victoria; and in 1901, King Edward VII made him Knight Commander. In the midst of all his many duties, he managed to gain a profound knowledge of the Bible, preach in various conferences, and write seventeen books.</p><h2>Sins Out of School (Dorothy Martin Mysteries, No. 8)</h2><p>Yearning for a traditional Thanksgiving turkey dinner, expatriate American and amateur sleuth Dorothy Martin finds her plans for her feast threatened when she is asked to assist at the local school after teacher Amanda Doyle, the prime suspect in the murder of her husband, mysteriously vanishes.</p><p>"When people see a gray-haired woman in a silly hat, they tend to dismiss her as a harmless crank," says sixtyish Dorothy Martin, an American who has lived for years in the ancient British hamlet of Sherebury, most recently with her retired detective husband. A day spent as a substitute teacher's aide leads her to Amanda, the teacher: closed, terrified, and soon accused of the murder of her monstrously repressive husband. Dorothy cannot keep out of it, especially when she meets the couple' s intense nine-year-old daughter. An estranged father who is a major public figure; a religious sect leached of all kindness; and a lot of bad accounting keep Dorothy on track, even as she tries to produce an American Thanksgiving in England and not tread too heavily on the toes of the investigating officers, erstwhile colleagues of her spouse. Dorothy may feel--and act--her age, but she is energetic and forthright, and an attractive and interesting companion even when the threads of the mystery unravel a bit. <i>GraceAnne DeCandido</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association. All rights reserved</i>A traditional American Thanksgiving dinner unexpectedly leads Dorothy Martin, now nearly 70 and settled in the medieval town of Sherebury with her retired police constable husband, Alan Nesbit, into a murder case as chilling as the British weather. This is Agatha-winner Dams's seventh mystery to feature the gutsy and intuitive amateur sleuth (after 2001's To Perish in Penzance). On Thanksgiving day, Dorothy takes nine-year-old Miriam Doyle into her home and heart after the girl's mother, a teacher, is accused of stabbing the girl's father to death. Encouraged by the police and advised by Alan, Dorothy investigates the murder. The local cathedral, quirky characters, erratic trains and lots of tea all figure in this traditional British cozy with a unique twist-an American Miss Marple as heroine.and other mysteries in her Hilda Johannson series.<br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Jump on Over!: The Adventures of Brer Rabbit and His Family</h2><p>A collection of five tales in which Brer Rabbit outwits Brer Fox, Brer Wolf, and Brer Bear in order to ensure his family&#39;s survival during a drought.</p><p></p><h2>Old Yeller</h2><p>The beloved tale of a family carving out a new life on the American frontier. <br>They made a home on Birdsong Creek, back in the 1980's, out in the Texas wilderness where a man and a woman could build a dream. These were people who took their joy, their courage, their greatness from the land. <br>There was Ma and Pa and little Arliss--and Travis, the fourteen-year-old whose father had left him to take care of things, and protect his mother and small brother while Pa was away driving a herd of cattle up to Abilene. It was hard work: plowing, chopping wood, tending the garden, hunting for food, and trying to keep Arliss in line. It was too big a job for a boy to do alone. It took that boy and a big, ugly, yellow dog who showed up out of nowhere one night--a dog that would bring them love and laughter and, in the end, a terrible heartache. <br>"Old Yeller" is more than just an account of a boy's love for his dog, more than just a tale of frontier life.

Bringing their many conversations over the years into sharper focus than ever before, Walsch in <i>What God Said </i>encourages readers to cast aside religious and cultural trappings.

And so Walsch has included solid suggestions on how to apply each of the 25 Core Messages in daily life, The author says that should humanity begin carrying these messages forward, starting today, they can literally change the world.</p><p><b>Neale Donald Walsch</b> is the author of the <i>Conversations with God</i> series of books, seven of which have made the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller lists. He has created a number of global projects revolving around the core messages found here, including an education program for children and a collaboration with people across the planet to invite serious and ongoing discussion of these ideas everywhere. Neale lives in southern Oregon with his wife, the American Poet Em Claire. The two travel and work together extensively, sharing with people around the world information they hope may help others in finding a deeper connection with themselves, their soul, and God.Walsch, who has written nine previous books about his conversations with God, here distills the essential elements of this new testament and offers specific ways readers can practice these core messages. The messages range from There is no such thing as Right and Wrong, there is only What Works and What Does Not Work, given what you are trying to do to We are all One. A lot of this is a mash-up of New Age philosophies, with a heaping portion of A Course in Miracles. But the approach here portions out the information in neat segments. Each of the 25 core messages is explained, followed by a list of meditations and activities (and lots of journaling) to apply it to everyday life. Even those drawn to the Conversation with God philosophy (and Walsch&#x2019;s books are international best-sellers) may balk at some of the suggestions, such as Don&#x2019;t do things you don&#x2019;t want to do, even at work.

What is the meaning of &#34;pre-industrial organization&#34;? In attempting to answer these questions, Jean Baudrillard examines the lessons of Marxism, which has created a productivist model and a fetishism of labor.

What he presents instead is a timely and chilling tale hinging on the power of Big Tobacco to bring the American government and economy to a standstill. Trevor Barnett, 32, is heir to a giant tobacco conglomerate called Terra. He is also a lazy ne'er-do-well who works for the company only because his trust payments are tied to his employment in the tobacco industry. He knows cigarette smoking kills people, but doesn't really care, believing that smokers have the right to make their own decisions. The tobacco industry is about to lose a $250-billion class-action lawsuit, a judgment the industry cannot appeal. Such a ruling will permanently bankrupt all of the tobacco companies, and Terra's ruthless CEO, Paul Trainer, is not about to let that happen. After making some snappy and irreverent comments at a board meeting, Trevor suddenly and unwillingly finds himself spearheading a tobacco offensive that shakes the nation. Big Tobacco closes all its plants and recalls all its tobacco products in a clever game of chicken, facing down the courts, Congress, the White House and the antismoking lobby. The result is a catastrophic loss of tax revenue and political donations, and an angry population of smoking voters who want their cigarettes back. The novel's plot is carefully crafted and original, filled with corporate and political intrigue, treachery, betrayal and the complex backroom deals that keep big companies humming along. With a refreshing lack of sanctimony, Mills turns the tobacco wars into grist for an absorbing business thriller. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Watercolor: Drybrush Technique (Artist&#39;s Library Series)</h2><p>Culmination of the work of artist Gene Franks with instructional information on each design.</p><p></p><h2>A Year of Stories and Things to Do</h2><p><p><b>A classic treasury of Shirley Hughes stories together with crafts, games, and activities for every month</b></p><p>This wonderful collection from Shirley Hughes takes young readers&nbsp;through the year with best-loved stories and poems for every month and mood.

Why have we allowed our environment to reach such a crisis? What produced the catastrophic population explosion that so taxes the earth&#39;s resources? Reg Morrison&#39;s search for answers led him to ponder our species&#39; astonishing evolutionary success. His extraordinary book describes how a spiritual outlook combined with a capacity for rational thought have enabled Homo sapiens to prosper through the millennia. It convincingly depicts these traits as part of our genetic makeup--and as the likely cause of our ultimate downfall against the inexorable laws of nature. The book will change the way readers think about human evolution and the fate of our species. Small bands of apes walked erect on the dangerous plains of East Africa several million years ago. Morrison marvels that they not only survived, but migrated to all corners of the earth and established civilizations. To understand this feat, he takes us back to a critical moment when these hominids developed language and with it the unique ability to think abstractly. He shows how at this same time they began to derive increasing advantage from their growing sense of spirituality. He convincingly depicts spirituality as an evolutionary strategy that helped rescue our ancestors from extinction and drive the species toward global dominance. Morrison concludes that this genetically productive spirituality, which has influenced every aspect of our lives, has led us to overpopulate the world and to devastate our own habitats. Sobering, sometimes chilling, consistently fascinating, his book offers a startling new view of human adaptation running its natural course.</p><p>Photojournalist Morrison (Australians Exposed, etc.) turns his attention to science writing in an attempt to describe and understand the world's growing ecological crisis. Though he writes with conviction and passion, he seems very much out of his depth when discussing scientific material. Morrison does an impressive job of summarizing the ways in which humans are altering the planet. He touches on the importance of biodiversity, the declining quality of agricultural lands, ozone destruction, global warming, acid precipitation and overpopulation, as well as a host of other critical issues. But the bulk of his book centers on his belief that virtually every aspect of our behavior is under strict genetic control. We are, in his terms, a plague animal, destined by our genes to reproduce abundantly and then, after destroying our environment, to endure a decimation of the species. As a metaphor, this is powerful stuff. Morrison isn't arguing metaphorically, however; rather, he contends that evolution, which he anthropomorphizes, is pushing us in this direction to protect the rest of the planet from our depredations. His conviction that genes dictate behavior lead him to political conclusions that are, by most lights, distressing. After saying that Hitler's policies arose from his lack of interest in sexual promiscuity, Morrison asserts that "national leaders who are discreetly promiscuous are merely displaying reassuring evidence of their well-balanced ambition and general genetic fitness for leadership." The kindest accurate description of this book is offered by Lynn Margulis in her very brief foreword, in which she refers to Morrison's ideas as "idiosyncratic." 49 b&amp;w photos, 22 drawings, one map. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Return of Martin Guerre</h2><p><p> The Inventive Peasant Arnaud du Tilh had almost persuaded the learned judges at the Parlement of Toulouse, when on a summer's day in 1560 a man swaggered into the court on a wooden leg, denounced Arnaud, and reestablished his claim to the identity, property, and wife of Martin Guerre. The astonishing case captured the imagination of the Continent. Told and retold over the centuries, the story of Martin Guerre became a legend, still remembered in the Pyrenean village where the impostor was executed more than 400 years ago. </p><p> Now a noted historian, who served as consultant for a new French film on Martin Guerre, has searched archives and lawbooks to add new dimensions to a tale already abundant in mysteries: we are led to ponder how a common man could become an impostor in the sixteenth century, why Bertrande de Rols, an honorable peasant woman, would accept such a man as her husband, and why lawyers, poets, and men of letters like Montaigne became so fascinated with the episode. </p><p> Natalie Zemon Davis reconstructs the lives of ordinary people, in a sparkling way that reveals the hidden attachments and sensibilities of nonliterate sixteenth-century villagers. Here we see men and women trying to fashion their identities within a world of traditional ideas about property and family and of changing ideas about religion. We learn what happens when common people get involved in the workings of the criminal courts in the <i>ancien r�gime</i>, and how judges struggle to decide who a man was in the days before fingerprints and photographs. We sense the secret affinity between the eloquent men of law and the honey-tongued village impostor, a rare identification across class lines. </p><p> Deftly written to please both the general public and specialists, <i>The Return of Martin Guerre</i> will interest those who want to know more about ordinary families and especially women of the past, and about the creation of literary legends. It is also a remarkable psychological narrative about where self-fashioning stops and lying begins. </p></p><p><b>Natalie Zemon Davis</b> is Henry Charles Lea Professor of History, Emerita, Princeton University.A fascinating reconstruction of a famous incident of impostorship and love in sixteenth-century rural France.

At a mind-blowing price, this ultimate, beautiful, illuminating, and really groovy look at the 1960s counterculture is rich in illustrations and filled with the history, politics, sayings, and slogans that defined the age. For those who were there, this volume will flash them back. For those who weren&#x2019;t, they&#x2019;ll wish they had been.</b><br><br>Sex, drugs, and rock and roll; peace rallies and riots in the ghettos; Flower Power, Black Power, and Gay Power; Mothers of Invention and Women&#x2019;s Liberation; Woodstock, Monterey Pop, and Altamont. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times: it all depends on whom you ask. But without a doubt the hippies transformed society. Every significant moment of the era comes vibrantly alive once again in psychedelic images, rare portraits of writers and musicians, dynamite poster and album artwork, and photographic records of political events that shook the world. Hundreds of unforgettable quotations come from seminal figures such as Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary, Grace Slick and George Harrison. Proceeding year by year from 1965 to 1971, <i>Hippie</i> gives an unprecedented degree of shape and coherence to an age&#x2014;that is kaleidoscopically astounding. <br><br><b>Barry Miles</b> was a central figure in the counterculture milieu. He wrote Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, as well as The Beatles: A Diary; contributed to I Want to Take You Higher, the Rock Music Hall of Fame&#x2019;s chronicle of psychedelic music. The Sixties is Miles&#x2019; own memoir of the decade.<br></p><p>Barry Miles is a respected chronicler of the Beat generation and 1960s culture. His autobiography in The Sixties was published in October 2002. He has written biographies of, among others, Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. He also recently wrote Paul MacCartney&#39;s Blackbird and the UK section of Let Me Take You Higher for Chronicle (in association with the Rock Music Hall of Fame). He worked for The Beatles Apple organisation in the late 1960s and was the founder of the international Times.The watershed 1960s can be gloriously re-experienced in the pages of this magnificent, oversize volume. The swinging '60s will live forever for the boomers who came of age in that decade; for their parents, who, at the time, felt uncomfortable with the abrupt shifts they observed in values and attitudes (to say nothing of dress); and now for their children, who listen to the rock music of that era and wonder, Was it really all that cool? Miles uses the hippie as a metaphor for the whole cultural experience of the 1960s and its impact on American--no, <i>world</i>--political and social life. As is so graphically documented here, the hippie was the epitome of the youth culture and very much defined the times. This was the great era of protest; hippies stood outside society, and, from that vantage point, they offered both valid and off-the-wall criticism. This luscious book, its textual accompaniment as spirited as its bounty of dynamic illustrations (including candid photos, album covers, and publicity shots), establishes the wide social boundaries of the movement--from antiwar activities to fashion and music and cinema--and spotlights the individuals most important to the counterculture, from Bob Dylan to Jim Morrison, from Ken Kesey to Abbie Hoffman. And, of course, the new-arrivals-display potential of this book in the public library is rich and varied. Wayne Koestenbaum's biography <i>Andy Warhol</i> (2001) could be set beside it as collateral reading, as could Bruce Spizer's <i>The Beatles Are Coming!</i> (2004) and the <i>Autobiography of Martin Luther King</i> (1998), a collection of King's writings. Also, don't forget to use books and even actual artifacts pertaining to gay liberation, fashions of the time, cinema, and all other aspects of distinctive '60s culture. <i>Brad Hooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Although known as the 'Sick Man of Europe', the empire still controlled significant parts of the Middle East. Intense diplomatic pressure from Germany culminated in a decision to join the Central Powers in October 1914. Russia had long coveted Ottoman territory, and the two empires clashed in the Caucasus. The Turks suffered a major defeat at Sarakamis, and their lack of success continued into 1916. However the Russian revolutions of 1917 led to the Russian forces in the area dissipating, and the following year the new Muslim-only 'Army of Islam' was sent to claim oil-rich Baku for the Turks, ousting the British-led defenders. In Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) the Ottoman defenders were at first defeated by the British, but General Townshend's decision to stay in Kut-al-Amara resulted in his eventual surrender in April 1916, a huge blow to Allied morale. The loss prompted the despatch of a much larger British force, and the subsequent capture of Baghdad and Mosul by the war's end. The persistent Ottoman threat to the Suez Canal led to the British offensive in Palestine. The capture of Jerusalem by General Allenby in 1917 was a welcome Christmas present for the Allies, while his subsequent victory at Megiddo, combined with the Arab Revolt inspired by Lawrence of Arabia, resulted in the capture of Damascus. However the defining struggle in this theatre was Gallipoli, the first time in over 200 years that Ottoman forces stood toe-to-toe with European troops and prevailed. The Gallipoli campaign had a profound effect not only on the Turks, but on the British, Australian and New Zealand troops who fought there, and marked the beginning of the end of European military supremacy in the region. With the aid of over 300 photographs, complemented by full-colour maps, <i>Gallipoli and the Middle East </i>provides a detailed guide to the background and conduct of World War I in all the theatres in which Ottoman forces were engaged.</p><p>Lieutenant Colonel (retired) Edward J.

In his new book, the Harvard scholar demonstrates how, throughout history, private ownership has served as a barrier to the power of the state, enabling the Western world to evolve enduring democratic institutions. He traces the development of private property, beginning with ancient Greece and Rome, where property rights in the modern sense first made their appearance. He explains how notions of ownership matured in late medieval times with the great expansion of commerce and the growth of cities. He shows how England, as the first country to treat land as a commodity and to develop a robust defense of property rights, also became the first to institute a parliamentary government capable of restraining the powers of royalty. In pre-nineteenth-century Russia, on the other hand, the absence of private land ownership deprived its citizens of the leverage to limit the authority of their tsars.<br><br>Pipes describes the attitudes toward property of twentieth-century totalitarian states and points out that in the United States the protection of private property, rooted in the principles of the Founding Fathers, has been a major contributor to the commonweal. However, he warns that contemporary trends in the treatment of property--in a century that, he suggests, has been unfavorable to the institution--threaten to undermine the rights of citizens. And he makes clear why he believes that excessive interference by government, even when intended to promote the "common good," could lead to a diminution of freedom.</p><p>Richard Pipes offers a vigorous defense of a fundamental freedom--private property--in this engaging mix of history, economics, and political theory. Western historians "take property for granted," complains the acclaimed scholar of Russian history (and author of the masterful <i>The Russian Revolution</i>). Pipes argues that a greater appreciation for this institution is necessary if liberty is to survive in the 21st century. "While property in some form is possible without liberty, the contrary is inconceivable," he says. Property rights give rise to the political and legal institutions that secure freedom. Their absence practically invites atrocity. The sinister regimes of Communist Russia and Nazi Germany were fiercely opposed to private property. Those regimes' "simultaneous violation of property rights and destruction of human lives," he emphasizes, "were not mere coincidences."<p> While the bulk of the book compares England and Russia, showing how varying attitudes toward private property led these two nations in totally different directions, the final section examines the broad theme of property rights in the late 20th century--a period when they have come under assault, and have been made increasingly conditional, by the growing strength of the welfare state. Pipes concludes with a broadside against New Deal and Great Society programs. Although liberal readers may bristle, none can deny that <i>Property and Freedom</i> is the product of a great mind tackling a big theme with great enthusiasm. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>"A most stimulating and original book. . . .

A Venetian Reckoning is her fourth novel to feature Commissario Brunetti, following Death at La Fenice, Death in a Strange Country and The Anonymous Venetian, and is followed by Acqua Alta and The Death of Faith.Donna Leon has an astute feel for Venice and all the passions and pride of Italian life. As her books are hard to find in America, audiobooks may lead listeners to a great new mystery series. Blackstone has published four of Leon&#39;s mysteries featuring police commisario Guido Brunetti and narrated by Anna Fields. While Fields is capable, she has the disadvantage of presenting a story with a male protagonist. Bill Wallis, narrating The Death of Faith, shows a thorough understanding of the rhythms and customs of Venice. He captures Brunetti&#39;s chauvinism and projects his delight in the food, architecture and people. He&#39;s deft at Brunetti&#39;s frustration with bureaucracy and, in this story, the Church. The stories are close to travelogues, with details that the casual or passionate visitor can revel in. R.F.W.

But Charlotte soon learns, to her mounting dismay, that for the uppercrust coeds of Dupont, sex, Cool, and kegs trump academic achievement every time.</p><p> </p><p> As Charlotte encounters Dupont's privileged elite--her roommate, Beverly, a Groton-educated Brahmin in lusty pursuit of lacrosse players; Jojo Johanssen, the only white starting player on Dupont's godlike basketball team, whose position is threatened by a hotshot black freshman from the projects; the Young Turk of Saint Ray fraternity, Hoyt Thorpe, whose heady sense of entitlement and social domination is clinched by his accidental brawl with a bodyguard for the governor of California; and Adam Geller, one of the Millennial Mutants who run the university's "independent" newspaper and who consider themselves the last bastion of intellectual endeavor on the sex-crazed, jock-obsessed campus--she gains a new, revelatory sense of her own power, that of her difference and of her very innocence, but little does she realize that she will act as a catalyst in all of their lives.

A philosopher poet, his nonfiction is infused with such passion and imagination that it matches the intensity and the appeal of Latin America's very best fiction.<br>Comprised of all new material, published here for the first time in a wonderful English translation by longtime collaborator Mark Fried, <i>Hunter of Stories</i> is a deeply considered collection of Galeano's final musings and stories on history, memory, humor, and tragedy. Written in his signature style--vignettes that fluidly combine dialogue, fables, and anecdotes--every page displays the original thinking and compassion that has earned Galeano decades and continents of renown.</p><p><b>Eduardo Galeano</b> (1940-2015) was one of Latin America's most distinguished writers. A Uruguayan journalist, writer, and novelist, he was considered, among other things, "a literary giant of the Latin American left" and "global soccer's preeminent man of letters." He is the author of the three-volume <i>Memory of Fire</i>,<i> Open Veins of Latin America</i>,<i> Soccer in Sun and Shadow</i>, <i>The Book of Embraces</i>, <i>Walking Words</i>, <i>Upside Down</i>, and <i>Voices in Time</i>. Born in Montevideo in 1940, he lived in exile in Argentina and Spain for years before returning to Uruguay. His work has been translated into twenty-eight languages. He is the recipient of many international prizes, including the first Lannan Prize for Cultural Freedom, the Casa de las Americas Prize, and the First Distinguished Citizen of the region by the countries of Mercosur. Galeano once described himself as "a writer obsessed with remembering, with remembering the past of America and above all that of Latin America, intimate land condemned to amnesia." Isabel Allende, who said her copy of Galeano's book was one of the few items with which she fled Chile in 1973 after the military coup of Augusto Pinochet, called <i>Open Veins of Latin America</i> "a mixture of meticulous detail, political conviction, poetic flair, and good storytelling.""This is Galeano's parting gift, arriving to us, like a message from another dimension, from beyond the grave. It is more generous, wise, and wonderful than I dared hope."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Naomi Klein</b>, author of <i>No Is Not Enough</i></i></b><br><br>"Galeano was a master of the shattered story. He had a way of making realism magical without being a magical realist. This book is yet another demonstration of his brilliance."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Arundhati Roy</b>, author of <i>The God of Small Things</i></i></b><br><br>"Story-hunter and -gatherer Galeano has captured a covey of extraordinary tales from the wise everybodies of the world and from his own wise observations. They are medicine for our times-tales to break our hearts open and restore us our humanity. To experience them alone is transformational. But to watch them soar to their full potential, they must be released from captivity and read aloud."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Sandra Cisneros</b>, author of <i>House on Mango Street</i></i></b><br><br>"Like a magician, combining on the page the arts of reading, storytelling and civic ethics, Eduardo Galeano conjures up for us long-forgotten images of our many worlds. If, as we have always suspected, our geographies spring from our stories, Galeano is our master geographer."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Alberto Manguel</b>, author of <i>The Dictionary of Imaginary Places</i></i></b><br><br>"Meticulously sculpted...with the lively and inimitable voice of a passionate rebel and storyteller... With a keen sense for ironic reversals and equal measures of sly humor, empathy, anguish, and hope, this compendium of bite-size stories of resistance (elegantly translated by longtime collaborator Fried) is a worthy addition to the celebrated oeuvre of a writer who remains a towering figure both as an artist and a voice of conscience across Latin America and the world."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Publisher's Weekly</b>, <i>Starred Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Bittersweet it is to read the final offering of a beloved, erudite, and wholly gifted author... In his nearly 75 years, Galeano continually spoke truth to power, yet also fostered beauty and a stylistic legacy all his own... <i>Hunter of Stories</i> is a fitting, final work of a man who spent his days (and undoubtedly so many nights) envisioning a finer world for all."<br> <br> &#x2015;<b><i><b>Jeremy Garber</b>, <i>Powell's Books</i></i></b><br><br>"A fitting final flourish for a literary giant of the Latin American left."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Kirkus Reviews</b></i></i></b><br><br>"[Galeano's] trenchant social critique and playful style suffuse these posthumously published vignettes: some deeply personal, many fiercely political, others simply wise and penetrating, and nearly all humorous, whether satirical or self-mocking... A swan song from one of Latin America's greatest storytellers, this work is rich with social conscience, humor, insight, outrage, and love. Recommended to all."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Library Journal</b>,<i> Starred Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Arranged with a novelist's gift for narrative sequence, a journalist's skepticism, and a storyteller's flair for dramatic tension...

A fitting finale for a lifetime of incisive writing."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Booklist</b>, <i>Starred Review</i></i></b><br><br><i>"Hunter of Stories </i>is a fitting bookend to Galeano's impressive literary career and a necessary book for all those who, like the author, care for the suffering of others and believe in the power of words to change minds and, perhaps, the world."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>World Literature Today</b></i></i></b></p><h2>American Samplers</h2><p>Unabridged republication of the original (1921) edition with black and white 128 plates, index, descriptive lists of American samplers with 416 pages of text.

In the early decades of the twentieth century, Hugh Kenner, observes, technology "tended to engulf people gradually, coercing behavior they were not aware of." The Modernist writers were sensitive to technological change, however, and throughout their works are reflections of this fact. Kenner shows, for example, how Eliot's lines "One thinks of all the hands/That are raising dingy shades/In a thousand furnished rooms" suggest the advent of the alarm clock and, beyond that, what the clocks enabled: "the new world of the commuter, in which a principal event was waking up in the morning under the obligation to get yourself somewhere else, and arrive there <em>on</em> <em>time</em>.<br> In fascinating examinations of Pound, Joyce, and Beckett, in addition to Eliot, Kenner looks at how inventions as various as the linotype, the typewriter, the subway, and the computer altered the way the world was viewed and depicted. Whether discussing Joyce's acute awareness of the nuances of typesetting or Beckett's experiments with a "proto-computer-language," Kenner consistently illuminates in fresh new ways the works of these authors and offers, almost incidentally, a wealth of anecdotes and asides that will delight the general reader and the literary specialist alike.</p><p>Hugh Kenner, Professor of English, Johns Hopkins University."[A] splendid exploration of the relation between the mechanization of society and the literary imagination....immensely readable."--Washington Times Magazine<br><br>"[Kenner's] new book on the influence of technology...on the literature of high modernism provides plenty of moment-by-moment evidence of why one should...find [him] the most lucid and riveting literary critic of his generation....Astonishing and satisfying."--Virginia Quarterly Review<br><br>"Kenner writes with such grace and generosity as to create in the mind of the reader the illusion of being as smart and well-read as Hugh Kenner."--The Harvard Bookshelf<br><br>"In this book,...there is more than enough fresh thinking and stimulating insights to warrant following him in new directions."--Magill's Literary Annual<br><br>"The basic elements of Kenner's style are all to be found here--the anecdotes, the facts, the judgments passed."--Boston Phoenix<br><br>"Provocative and often entertaining."--ISIS<br><br>"Kenner is both learned and playful, teasing ideas out of a wealth of fascinating detail. Highly recommended."--Library Journal<br><br>"As long as Hugh Kenner is on the job, the holes that the great Modernists left in their texts will not be filled in by mistake, and the artifacts of the great innovators will be scrupulously maintained."--American Literature</p><h2>Shadow of the Moon</h2><p>THIS IS BRAND NEW BOOK.WE PROVIDE 100% CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.</p><p>M.

He taught at the University of Toronto from 1946 to 1979 and became popular for his aphorism, &#34;the medium is the message&#34; which summarized his view of the media&#39;s potent influence on shaping culture and styles of thinking. His major writings include The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962), Understanding Media (1964), and The Medium Is the Massage (1967).''Culture Is Our Business represents an essential component of McLuhan's body of work and provides an important contribution to media ecology, cultural studies, and media literacy.

It hardly mattered that Thomas was a graduate of Harvard Business School, or that he went to work for a great Wall Street firm and succeeded beyond expectations. In Lucy's eyes, he remained irremediably a "townie." Decades later, a chance meeting brings Lucy together with Philip, our narrator. They'd known each other earlier, and he remembers her as a ravishing, funny, ready-for-anything hellion with a well-earned reputation for generosity with sexual favors. He also remembers Thomas, killed in a freak accident years after his and Lucy's divorce, and is shocked to hear Lucy refer to Thomas insistently as "that monster." How is he to reconcile that unexpected and overflowing reservoir of bitterness and resentments with his own memories? Almost against his will, Philip sets out on a quest that soon becomes an obsession to discover who exactly these friends were whom he had understood so incompletely, and what happened in their marriage. Through Philip's patient probing, a brilliant portrait emerges of Begley's heroine: infinitely complex, irresistible as well as insufferable, capable of extremes of arrogance and submission, and driven by sexual appetites she cannot control. Lucy de Bourgh is without doubt one of Begley's strongest and most outrageous creations.</p><p>LOUIS BEGLEY's previous novels are <i>Schmidt Steps Back</i>, <i>Matters of Honor</i>, <i>Shipwreck, Schmidt Delivered</i>, <i>Mistler's Exit</i>, <i>About Schmidt</i>, <i>As Max Saw It</i>, <i>The Man Who Was Late</i>, and <i>Wartime Lies</i>, which won the Hemingway/PEN award and was a finalist for the National Book Award. His work has been translated into eighteen languages.One evening in May 2003, not many days after George W. Bush&#x2019;s astonishing announcement that the &#x201c;mission&#x201d; had been accomplished, I went to the New York State Theater to see a performance by the New York City Ballet company. I had hoped to find an all Jerry Robbins program, and there was, in fact, such a program scheduled for later that month. Unfortunately, the date was inconvenient&#x2014;I had accepted a dinner invitation from a newly remarried classmate&#x2014;and I had to settle for a performance that included the official premiere of <i>Guide to Strange Places</i>, one more of Peter Martins&#x2019;s empty creations. The music by John Adams left me indifferent. If only, I said to myself, Martins had allowed us to go on thinking of him as the magnificent dancer he had been in his prime and being grateful for his management of the company, instead of giving us again and again occasions to deplore his choreography. Unable to concentrate on the movements, brilliantly executed by the cast, that seemed to me to lead to nowhere, I allowed my thoughts to turn to Jerome Robbins. He had been my wife Bella&#x2019;s and my dear friend, regularly inviting us to rehearsals. We would watch him go over each segment of a ballet tirelessly: scolding, correcting, and cajoling, until a mysterious change, often imperceptible to Bella and me, signaled that the music and the dance had come together and now corresponded to his vision. He would clap his hands, turn to his assistant Victor, and say, That&#x2019;s it, the kids have got it, let&#x2019;s go and eat. Jerry was ravenously hungry after rehearsals. We would tag along with him and Victor to Shun Lee, a Chinese restaurant on West Sixty-Fifth Street, where Jerry, so abstemious in daily life, devoured one after another the mild Cantonese dishes that were his favorites. He died in 1998, fifteen years after George Balanchine, and the curtain went down on a great era in ballet history that their work had defined. I was grateful to have seen so much of it while they were still alive, danced by dancers they had formed. Would the company for which they had created so many masterpieces continue to perform them in high style? I hoped it would, at least for the remainder of my years.<br> &nbsp;<br> At the intermission, I got a whiskey at the bar and, the weather being mild, went out on the open terrace. The fountain in the center of the plaza had not yet been redesigned and programmed to keep time to a beat as intricate as Fred Astaire&#x2019;s steps and no easier to decipher, but I liked it anyway and never tired of looking at it. I was bewitched. How wonderful, I said to myself over and over, how glad&#x2014;really how happy&#x2014;I am to have come back to live in this city! For much of my life I had dreaded admitting to myself or others that I was happy. To do so, I was certain, was to invite the gods to strike where I was most vulnerable. Not my own person, but Bella or our little Agnes. Alas, the full measure of punishment had already been meted out, leaving me diminished but invulnerable. We had been living between Paris and New York, with longer stays abroad because of Bella&#x2019;s family, all of whom were there. Soon after the beginning of one of our New York sojourns Agnes was killed&#x2014;instantaneously&#x2014;by the falling limb of a tree in Central Park, which also gravely injured the nurse who was taking her home from the Children&#x2019;s Zoo. Our grief was extreme. Unable to speak about the disaster for two years or more, we suffered in silence and, without need for discussion, concluded that we would not have another child; Agnes&#x2019;s place could not be taken, and we did not wish to give another hostage to fortune. We stayed away from New York as much as possible, learning to live for each other and for our work. We were hardly ever apart. I am a writer and so was Bella; we designated as our offices two adjoining rooms of every habitation we occupied, whether in New York City or the house on a rocky hillside outside Sharon, Connecticut, I inherited in the fifties from a maiden aunt or the apartment in Paris near the Panth�on.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then one winter, which for professional reasons we were spending in New York, Bella, who had never complained of an ache or a pain, who never caught colds or allowed jetlag to upset her sleep pattern, whose digestion triumphed over every cuisine, began to suffer from lingering sniffles and strange little infections; red blotches appeared on her skin. She joked that if either of us were a drug addict sharing needles or sleeping with fellow addicts she would think she had AIDS. But in her case, she said, she had simply been beaten down by the interminable New York winter. I thought she was right. For the first time in our lives we went south in search of the sun, to Barbados, the only appealing island where a place to stay that met our requirements&#x2014;those indispensable two offices and close proximity to the beach&#x2014;was immediately available at a price that was not outrageous. The beach house in St. James turned out to be perfect. We worked at our desks starting in the early morning. Before lunch, we luxuriated for an hour or two in the sun and the caressing Caribbean Sea that regaled us with an unending fashion show of fish darting about the coral reef, and then went home for lunch and the postprandial nap that was our moment of choice for making love. Afterward, until late in the evening, we worked again. After a week of this paradisal existence, Bella told me, as we were leaving the lunch table, that for once we would have to rest quietly during our nap. She hurt everywhere and, it seemed to her, particularly down there. She had noticed some strange bleeding. Would I mind? Immediately, I told her that we must book seats on the next available flight to New York and see our family doctor and whomever else he thought appropriate. She refused categorically, insisting that we stay on the island through the remaining two weeks of our lease. There was no reason to sacrifice even one moment of our idyll. It didn&#x2019;t take long, however, after we returned to the city to learn that there had been reasons aplenty. Bella&#x2019;s symptoms were those of acute lymphoblastic leukemia that had attacked her bone marrow and was methodically, implacably subverting it. Increasingly draconic treatments would be followed by perhaps a month&#x2019;s remission. The cycle was repeated over and over, leaving Bella ravaged and exhausted, with no hope of cure or longer-lasting remission, according to her hematologist, other than a successful bone marrow transplant. Bella&#x2019;s only sibling, her older brother, was eager to be the donor. The consanguinity and the resulting near perfect match of their blood types reduced considerably the risk of rejection. After considering the protocol she would be required to observe following the transplant, and the benefits she could expect, about which she was stubbornly skeptical, Bella decided against the procedure. I don&#x2019;t believe this cancer will leave my body, and I don&#x2019;t care about gaining a couple of years, she said. They won&#x2019;t be good years. We&#x2019;ve had such a splendid life together. Let&#x2019;s not settle for one in which I will be so horribly diminished. Neither of us wants that. There was no hiding of the fact that I agreed. With the help of opiates we had saved up she died in my arms, peacefully, some six months later. And what can be said of me? I am on a rack, but I still have my work. I do it conscientiously and modestly for the pleasure it gives me, expecting no other award. And I have my memories. Dante&#x2019;s Virgil was wrong to tell him that there is no greater sorrow than to remember past happy times when one is in misery. Memory is a solace. Perhaps the only one. Memory is also the best of companions.<br> &nbsp;<br> My reverie was interrupted by a voice I knew, although I didn&#x2019;t immediately identify it, calling out my name: Philip! I turned and saw a tall slim lady in her late sixties or per haps early seventies, strikingly good looking and turned out in a black suit I attributed to Armani and black pumps. A black pocketbook hung from her shoulder on a gold chain. I blinked as I realized who she was. Many years had passed since I had last seen her. How many I couldn&#x2019;t immediately calculate. But yes, without doubt, it was she.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Was It the Chocolate Pudding?: A Story For Little Kids About Divorce</h2><p>Readers learn about divorce, and receive age-appropriate explanations of what is happening regarding such issues as single-parent homes and joint custody as well as how divorce is a grown-up problem, not the child&#39;s fault.

An outwardly simple tale of a linen weaver, it is notable for its strong realism and its sophisticated treatment of a variety of issues ranging from religion to industrialisation to community.The novel is set in the early years of the 19th century. Silas Marner, a weaver, is a member of a small Calvinist congregation in Lantern Yard, a slum street in an unnamed city in Northern England. He is falsely accused of stealing the congregation's funds while watching over the very ill deacon. Two clues are given against Silas: a pocket knife, and the discovery in his own house of the bag formerly containing the money. There is the strong suggestion that Silas' best friend, William Dane, has framed him, since Silas had lent his pocket knife to William shortly before the crime was committed. Silas is proclaimed guilty. The woman Silas was to marry breaks their engagement and later marries William. With his life shattered and his heart broken, Silas leaves Lantern Yard and the city.</p></p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

This is the number of your fate.</p><p>Three?</p><p>Yes, three is mystic. Three stands at the heart of the mantra.</p><p>Which three?</p><p>The first is dark-haired. He stands on the brink of robbery and murder. A demon has infested him. The name of the demon is HEROIN.</p><p>Which demon is that? I know it not, even from nursery stories.</p><p>He tried to speak but his voice was gone, the voice of the oracle, Star-Slut, Whore of the Winds, both were gone; he saw a card fluttering down from nowhere to nowhere, turning and turning in the lazy dark. On it a baboon grinned from over the shoulder of a young man with dark hair; its disturbingly human fingers were buried so deeply in the young man's neck that their tips had disappeared in flesh. Looking more closely, the gunslinger saw the baboon held a whip in one of those clutching, strangling hands. The face of the ridden man seemed to writhe in wordless terror.</p><p>The Prisoner, the man in black (who had once been a man the gunslinger trusted, a man named Walter) whispered chummily. A trifle upsetting, isn't he? A trifle upsetting ... a trifle upsetting ... a trifle-</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>The gunslinger snapped awake, waving at something with his mutilated hand, sure that in a moment one of the monstrous shelled things from the Western Sea would drop on him, desperately enquiring in its foreign tongue as it pulled his face off his skull.</p><p>Instead a sea-bird, attracted by the glister of the morning sun on the buttons of his shirt, wheeled away with a frightened squawk.</p><p>Roland sat up.</p><p>His hand throbbed wretchedly, endlessly. His right foot did the same. Both fingers and toe continued to insist they were there. The bottom half of his shirt was gone; what was left resembled a ragged vest. He had used one piece to bind his hand, the other to bind his foot.</p><p>Go away, he told the absent parts of his body. You are ghosts now. Go away.</p><p>It helped a little. Not much, but a little. They were ghosts, all right, but lively ghosts.</p><p>The gunslinger ate jerky. His mouth wanted it little, his stomach less, but he insisted. When it was inside him, he felt a little stronger. There was not much left, though; he was nearly up against it.</p><p>Yet things needed to be done.</p><p>He rose unsteadily to his feet and looked about. Birds swooped and dived, but the world seemed to belong to only him and them. The monstrosities were gone. Perhaps they were nocturnal; perhaps tidal. At the moment it seemed to make no difference.</p><p>The sea was enormous, meeting the horizon at a misty blue point that was impossible to determine. For a long moment the gunslinger forgot his agony in its contemplation. He had never seen such a body of water. Had heard of it in children's stories, of course, had even been assured by his teachers-some, at least-that it existed-but to actually see it, this immensity, this amazement of water after years of arid land, was difficult to accept ... difficult to even see.</p><p>He looked at it for a long time, enrapt, making himself see it, temporarily forgetting his pain in wonder.</p><p>But it was morning, and there were still things to be done.</p><p>He felt for the jawbone in his back pocket, careful to lead with the palm of his right hand, not wanting the stubs of his fingers to encounter it if it was still there, changing that hand's ceaseless sobbing to screams.</p><p>It was.</p><p>All right.</p><p>Next.</p><p>He clumsily unbuckled his gunbelts and laid them on a sunny rock. He removed the guns, swung the chambers out, and removed the useless shells. He threw them away. A bird settled on the bright gleam tossed back by one of them, picked it up in its beak, then dropped it and flew away.</p><p>The guns themselves must be tended to, should have been tended to before this, but since no gun in this world or any other was more than a club without ammunition, he laid the gunbelts themselves over his lap before doing anything else and carefully ran his left hand over the leather.</p><p>Each of them was damp from buckle and clasp to the point where the belts would cross his hips; from that point they seemed dry. He carefully removed each shell from the dry portions of the belts. His right hand kept trying to do this job, insisted on forgetting its reduction in spite of the pain, and he found himself returning it to his knee again and again, like a dog too stupid or fractious to heel. In his distracted pain he came close to swatting it once or twice.</p><p>I see serious problems ahead, he thought again.</p><p>He put these shells, hopefully still good, in a pile that was dishearteningly small. Twenty. Of those, a few would almost certainly misfire. He could depend on none of them. He removed the rest and put them in another pile. Thirty-seven.</p><p>Well, you weren't heavy loaded, anyway, he thought, but he recognized the difference between fifty-seven live rounds and what might be twenty. Or ten. Or five. Or one. Or none.</p><p>He put the dubious shells in a second pile.</p><p>He still had his purse. That was one thing. He put it in his lap and then slowly disassembled his guns and performed the ritual of cleaning. By the time he was finished, two hours had passed and his pain was so intense his head reeled with it; conscious thought had become difficult. He wanted to sleep. He had never wanted that more in his life. But in the service of duty there was never any acceptable reason for denial.</p><p>"Cort," he said in a voice that he couldn't recognize, and laughed dryly.</p><p>Slowly, slowly, he reassembled his revolvers and loaded them with the shells he presumed to be dry. When the job was done, he held the one made for his left hand, cocked it ... and then slowly lowered the hammer again. He wanted to know, yes. Wanted to know if there would be a satisfying report when he squeezed the trigger or only another of those useless clicks. But a click would mean nothing, and a report would only reduce twenty to nineteen ... or nine ... or three ... or none.</p><p>He tore away another piece of his shirt, put the other shells-the ones which had been wetted-in it, and tied it, using his left hand and his teeth. He put them in his purse.</p><p>Sleep, his body demanded. Sleep, you must sleep, now, before dark, there's nothing left, you're used up- He tottered to his feet and looked up and down the deserted strand. It was the color of an undergarment which has gone a long time without washing, littered with sea-shells which had no color. Here and there large rocks protruded from the gross-grained sand, and these were covered with guano, the older layers the yellow of ancient teeth, the fresher splotches white.</p><p>The high-tide line was marked with drying kelp. He could see pieces of his right boot and his waterskins lying near that line. He thought it almost a miracle that the skins hadn't been washed out to sea by high-surging waves. Walking slowly, limping exquisitely, the gunslinger made his way to where they were. He picked up one of them and shook it by his ear. The other was empty. This one still had a little water left in it. Most would not have been able to tell the difference between the two, but the gunslinger knew each just as well as a mother knows which of her identical twins is which. He had been travelling with these waterskins for a long, long time. Water sloshed inside. That was good-a gift. Either the creature which had attacked him or any of the others could have torn this or the other open with one casual bite or slice of claw, but none had and the tide had spared it. Of the creature itself there was no sign, although the two of them had finished far above the tide-line. Perhaps other predators had taken it; perhaps its own kind had given it a burial at sea, as the elaphaunts, giant creatures of whom he had heard in childhood stories, were reputed to bury their own dead.</p><p>He lifted the waterskin with his left elbow, drank deeply, and felt some strength come back into him. The right boot was of course ruined ... but then he felt a spark of hope. The foot itself was intact-scarred but intact-and it might be possible to cut the other down to match it, to make something which would last at least awhile.... Faintness stole over him. He fought it but his knees unhinged and he sat down, stupidly biting his tongue.</p><p>You won't fall unconscious, he told himself grimly. Not here, not where another of those things can come back tonight and finish the job.</p><p>So he got to his feet and tied the empty skin about his waist, but he had only gone twenty yards back toward the place where he had left his guns and purse when he fell down again, half-fainting. He lay there awhile, one cheek pressed against the sand, the edge of a seashell biting against the edge of his jaw almost deep enough to draw blood. He managed to drink from the waterskin, and then he crawled back to the place where he had awakened. There was a Joshua tree twenty yards up the slope-it was stunted, but it would offer at least some shade.</p><p>To Roland the twenty yards looked like twenty miles.</p><p>Nonetheless, he laboriously pushed what remained of his possessions into that little puddle of shade. He lay there with his head in the grass, already fading toward what could be sleep or unconsciousness or death. He looked into the sky and tried to judge the time. Not noon, but the size of the puddle of shade in which he rested said noon was close. He held on a moment longer, turning his right arm over and bringing it close to his eyes, looking for the telltale red lines of infection, of some poison seeping steadily toward the middle of him.</p><p>The palm of his hand was a dull red. Not a good sign.</p><p>I jerk off left-handed, he thought, at least that's something.</p><p>Then darkness took him, and he slept for the next sixteen hours with the sound of the Western Sea pounding ceaselessly in his dreaming ears.</p><p><b>3</b></p><p>When the gunslinger awoke again the sea was dark but there was faint light in the sky to the east. Morning was on its way. He sat up and waves of dizziness almost overcame him.</p><p>He bent his head and waited.</p><p>When the faintness had passed, he looked at his hand. It was infected, all right-a tell-tale red swelling that spread up the palm and to the wrist. It stopped there, but already he could see the faint beginnings of other red lines, which would lead eventually to his heart and kill him. He felt hot, feverish.</p><p>I need medicine, he thought. But there is no medicine here.</p><p>Had he come this far just to die, then? He would not. And if he were to die in spite of his determination, he would die on his way to the Tower.</p><p>How remarkable you are, gunslinger! the man in black tittered inside his head. How indomitable! How romantic in your stupid obsession!</p><p>"Fuck you," he croaked, and drank. Not much water left, either. There was a whole sea in front of him, for all the good it could do him; water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink. Never mind.</p><p>He buckled on his gunbelts, tied them-this was a process which took so long that before he was done the first faint light of dawn had brightened to the day's actual prologue-and then tried to stand up. He was not convinced he could do it until it was done.</p><p>Holding to the Joshua tree with his left hand, he scooped up the not-quite-empty waterskin with his right arm and slung it over his shoulder. Then his purse. When he straightened, the faintness washed over him again and he put his head down, waiting, willing.</p><p>The faintness passed.</p><p>Walking with the weaving, wavering steps of a man in the last stages of ambulatory drunkenness, the gunslinger made his way back down to the strand. He stood, looking at an ocean as dark as mulberry wine, and then took the last of his jerky from his purse. He ate half, and this time both mouth and stomach accepted a little more willingly. He turned and ate the other half as he watched the sun come up over the mountains where Jake had died-first seeming to catch on the cruel and treeless teeth of those peaks, then rising above them.</p><p>Roland held his face to the sun, closed his eyes, and smiled. He ate the rest of his jerky.</p><p>He thought: Very well. I am now a man with no food, with two less fingers and one less toe than I was born with; I am a gunslinger with shells which may not fire; I am sickening from a monster's bite and have no medicine; I have a day's water if I'm lucky; I may be able to walk perhaps a dozen miles if I press myself to the last extremity. I am, in short, a man on the edge of everything.</p><p>Which way should he walk? He had come from the east; he could not walk west without the powers of a saint or a savior. That left north and south.</p><p>North.</p><p>That was the answer his heart told. There was no question in it.</p><p>North.</p><p>The gunslinger began to walk.</p><p><b>4</b></p><p>He walked for three hours. He fell twice, and the second time he did not believe he would be able to get up again. Then a wave came toward him, close enough to make him remember his guns, and he was up before he knew it, standing on legs that quivered like stilts.</p><p>He thought he had managed about four miles in those three hours. Now the sun was growing hot, but not hot enough to explain the way his head pounded or the sweat pouring down his face; nor was the breeze from the sea strong enough to explain the sudden fits of shuddering which sometimes gripped him, making his body lump into gooseflesh and his teeth chatter.</p><p>Fever, gunslinger, the man in black tittered. What's left inside you has been touched afire.</p><p>The red lines of infection were more pronounced now; they had marched upward from his right wrist halfway to his elbow.</p><p>He made another mile and drained his waterbag dry. He tied it around his waist with the other. The landscape was monotonous and unpleasing. The sea to his right, the mountains to his left, the gray, shell-littered sand under the feet of his cut-down boots. The waves came and went. He looked for the lobstrosities and saw none. He walked out of nowhere toward nowhere, a man from another time who, it seemed, had reached a point of pointless ending.</p><p>Shortly before noon he fell again and knew he could not get up. This was the place, then. Here.

What powers an enterprise to the top and keeps it there?<br><br>I&#x2019;ve been fascinated by these questions throughout my business career, from my first job after college to my seven years as global marketing officer of Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) to my current work as a senior management consultant, an adjunct professor at the UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management, and a board member of Motorola Mobility and AOL.<br><br>I believe I&#x2019;ve found the answer. It is a new framework for business, based on improving the lives of the people a business serves, that is rooted in the timeless fundamentals of business and human nature. The latest research, including a ten-year-growth study I conducted of more than 50,000 brands around the world, has inspired and validated this new framework. By operating according to the principles in this framework, the world&#x2019;s best businesses achieve growth three times or more that of the competition in their categories.<br><br>The central principle of the new framework is the importance of having a brand ideal, a shared goal of improving people&#x2019;s lives. A brand ideal is a business&#x2019;s essential reason for being, the higher-order benefit it brings to the world. A brand ideal of improving people&#x2019;s lives is the only sustainable way to recruit, unite, and inspire all the people a business touches, from employees to customers. It is the only thing that enduringly connects the core beliefs of the people inside a business with the fundamental human values of the people the business serves. Without that connection, without a brand ideal, no business can truly excel.<br><br>You will hear a lot about brands in what follows, but a word of explanation first. I use the words brand and business interchangeably. A brand is what a business is all about in the hearts and minds of the people most important to its future. In any competitive market, what drives margin and growth and separates one business from another--for employees, customers, partners, and investors--is the brand. And what increasingly separates great companies and businesses from good, bad, or indifferent ones is brand ideals.<br><br>I first saw the full potential of brand ideals in several line management roles at Procter &amp; Gamble, and then as the company&#x2019;s global marketing officer. The evidence I&#x2019;m going to present shows that an ability to leverage brand ideals is also what increasingly separates great business leaders from good, bad, or indifferent ones.<br><br>Think about what and how you buy in your business and personal life. Whether it&#x2019;s household products or enterprise data services, what ultimately determines why you buy from one company rather than another? It&#x2019;s their brands&#x2019; images and reputations and the relationships you have with them. A brand is simply the collective intent of the people behind it; a brand defines who you are and what you stand for as a business to everyone the business touches, from employees to end consumers. If you want great business results, you and your brand have to stand for something compelling. And that&#x2019;s where brand ideals enter the equation.<br><br>Great business leaders of the past have always understood and acted on this, explicitly or implicitly. When William Hewlett and David Packard founded Hewlett-Packard (HP) in 1939, and in the process kick-started all of Silicon Valley, they explicitly focused their business on making a contribution to society through technology. They didn&#x2019;t call this a brand ideal, but that&#x2019;s what it was. As Dave Packard said, the reason people join together in a business is to &#x201c;make a contribution to society, a phrase which sounds trite but is fundamental.&#x201d; And as Bill Hewlett said, &#x201c;We operated on the assumption that if we made a contribution to society, rewards would follow.&#x201d;<br><br>Indeed they did. The ideal of improving people&#x2019;s lives with ever-advancing technology has kept HP going--and growing--through thick and thin ever since. The company lost momentum in 2011, as most tech companies do at some point due to the rapidly evolving sector. Still, HP&#x2019;s record of growth in the decade of the 2000s was impressive; according to global research firm Millward Brown Optimor, HP grew their brand value from $5 billion in 2001 to $35.4 billion in 2011.<br><br>In my research visit to HP, in several long interviews, I felt HP people--even with the dramatic and unsettling change in their management and board--had internalized the power and potential of a brand ideal, and how it inspires growth. HP director of market research Deepak Sainanee told me, &#x201c;In terms of growth and margin, brand is really what it comes down to in the end.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s no coincidence, as we&#x2019;ll see, that HP, one of the world&#x2019;s largest technology companies, is beginning to leverage a powerful new evolution of its brand ideal, in spite of the turmoil in senior management.<br><br>Today&#x2019;s most successful business leaders are also leveraging brand ideals. Brand ideals, my research associates and I have found, are what enable today&#x2019;s greatest companies to set the pace in their categories and leave their competition far behind.<br><br>THE 400 PERCENT ADVANTAGE<br><br>Recall that chart we just looked at in the introduction. Over the 2000s the Stengel 50, the top businesses in my ten-year-growth study, have generated a return on investment 400 percent better than the Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s 500. As we will see, the Stengel 50 are achieving this remarkable success thanks to operating in harmony with their brand ideals. In so doing, the Stengel 50 are riding the crest of a building wave that is reshaping all of business, a dramatic, inexorable rise in the contribution of intangible brand value to total business value.<br><br>Brand research and consulting firm Millward Brown Optimor--I partnered with them in my research for this book, and I&#x2019;ll be referring to them often--has a well-established proprietary methodology for calculating brand value. Millward Brown Optimor determines intangible earnings by examining a business&#x2019;s financial results and calculating the percentage of demand for its offerings that is attributable to brand alone. When Millward Brown Optimor recently looked at the contribution that brand equity has made to the market capitalization of the Standard &amp; Poor&#x2019;s 500 from 1980 to 2011, it tracked the birth and development of an ongoing trend.<br><br>In 1980 virtually the entire market capitalization of the S&amp;P 500 companies consisted of tangible assets (cash, offices, plants, equipment, inventories, etc.). In 2010 tangible assets accounted for only 40 to 45 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies' market capitalization. The rest of their capitalization consisted of intangible assets, and about half of that--more than 30 percent of total market capitalization--came from brand.<br><br>The growth in the importance of brand value over the last thirty years is unmistakable. Brand value is now most companies&#x2019; single biggest asset, and the consequence is that business leadership and brand leadership are converging in every industry and every sector of the economy. The world&#x2019;s best companies have responded to this by ensuring that they bring together business leadership and brand leadership in the C-suite and throughout their organizations.<br><br>In short, businesses are now only as strong as their brands, and nothing else offers business leaders so much potential leverage. That is why I believe every business leader--whether you are selling cars, chemicals, or cosmetics--needs to think and act like a brand leader.<br><br>The business case for brand ideals is not about altruism or corporate social responsibility. It&#x2019;s about expressing a business&#x2019;s fundamental reason for being and powering its growth. It&#x2019;s about linking and leveraging the behaviors of all the people important to a business&#x2019;s future, because nothing unites and motivates people&#x2019;s actions as strongly as ideals. They make it possible to connect what happens inside a business with what happens outside it, especially in the &#x201c;black box&#x201d; of people&#x2019;s minds and how they make decisions. Ideals are the ultimate driver, my research has found, of category-leading growth.<br>One way or another, I&#x2019;ve been homing in on the business value of ideals since I was an eleven-year-old kid in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, with a neighborhood paper route and a lawn-cutting and snow-shoveling business. In hindsight all three jobs showed me that understanding what my customers valued and trying to improve their lives produced a big payoff. These weren&#x2019;t things I thought about consciously, of course; rather, I did them intuitively.<br><br>Knowing that the arrival of the paper punctuated the day for the retirees on my route, I knocked on the door, handed them the paper, and took a moment to chat. This brought me lots of freshly baked cookies and other treats and little tips through the year, and over-the-top tips at Christmas.<br><br>In snow shoveling and lawn cutting, I always looked for more that I could do for each customer. I was upselling before I ever heard the word. Could I shovel the sidewalk and the driveway as well as the front walk? Could I trim the hedge as well as cut the lawn? When customers went away for the summer or on a long vacation, I said, &#x201c;I want to keep the yard looking nice for you, so why don&#x2019;t I mow your lawn every five to seven days?&#x201d; That made each mowing easier because I wasn&#x2019;t hacking through deep grass, and I got paid more for cutting the lawn more often. All in all it was a nice portfolio of work until I graduated to more serious jobs, such as a summer on a road crew.<br><br>My first grown-up job, after graduating from Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, provided a complementary lesson on understanding customers&#x2019; fundamental values. Time-Life Books was then moving from New York City to Alexandria, Virginia, and I joined its editorial department there. I enjoyed helping assemble and market multivolume book sets on a wide range of subjects, but the longer I was there, the more I felt that the organization was going to hit a wall.<br><br>Again, this is all in hindsight, but the leaders of the business failed to question the continuing viability of their business model. They had an organization with great equity in packaging and presenting infotainment, nonfiction subject matter with targeted demographic appeal. But they never asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s special about this organization? What do we stand for in our customers&#x2019; minds? What can we do if they stop buying book series on World War II and the Old West?&#x201d;<br><br>In the years after I left to pursue an MBA at Pennsylvania State University&#x2019;s Smeal College of Business and then joined Procter &amp; Gamble, the leadership of Time-Life Books kept ignoring that question even as it grew more urgent. Scattered successes kept Time-Life Books alive until 2003. Its decline through the 1980s and 1990s paralleled the birth and growth of niche cable television, which met the same infotainment needs in the form of channels such as the Learning Channel, the Weather Channel, the Food Network, the History Channel, and the Discovery Channel.<br><br>Can you imagine Time-Life entering that mix as a channel of its own or as a producer of programming for the new channels? Certainly a business with Time-Life&#x2019;s value in the public&#x2019;s mind had a genuine chance to do so in the early- to -mid 1980s. As the 1980s drew to a close and the 1990s wore on, however, it became harder and harder to conceive of Time-Life pulling off such a move.<br><br>Perhaps those who know the Time-Life culture intimately will say it was never possible, or that the business never had sufficient resources of its own or enough of a draw on the resources of its parent company, first Time, Inc., and then Time Warner. Well, compare how the National Geographic Society built on the brand value of National Geographic magazine to create the National Geographic Channel, extending their brand from magazine into new channels and offerings.<br><br>Remain stuck inside your current business model, and your business&#x2019;s days are numbered. Make a brand ideal your North Star, and the sky&#x2019;s the limit. That&#x2019;s because a brand ideal powerfully inspires continuous innovation toward a higher-order benefit. In what follows, I&#x2019;ll share many examples of how today&#x2019;s most successful business leaders orient their innovation programs around their brand ideals. You&#x2019;ll hear about this directly from the leaders themselves, as they shared their insights, principles, and practices with me during my research visits to their category-dominating businesses.<br><br>Because Time-Life&#x2019;s leadership never asked what the organization&#x2019;s reason for being was besides selling multivolume book series, they were never able to rally the organization around a higher-order ideal of improving the lives of the people they served. If Time-Life had seized the ideal of satisfying people&#x2019;s endless curiosity about the world&#x2019;s wonders, as the Discovery Channel soon did (as we&#x2019;ll see, ideals cannot be proprietary, but distinctive ways of fulfilling them can be), it could have envisioned a transition to other media before its existing business model became obsolete. If not a cable television channel or content producer, Time-Life might have become a dot-com that attracted growing communities of interest in different subject areas, as AOL did and continues to do. And as Facebook, Zynga, LinkedIn, and China&#x2019;s RenRen are doing so effectively, as they too attract communities of people around common interests.<br><br>WHY CHOOSY MOTHERS REALLY CHOSE JIF<br><br>Going to work at P&amp;G brought me into one of the world&#x2019;s great companies with extraordinary people and capabilities. The pivotal assignment of the early part of my career there was working on Jif peanut butter, a $250 million business in P&amp;G&#x2019;s food and beverage division. From assistant brand manager to brand manager to associate marketing director, I was involved with the Jif business for six years, an unusually long time compared to P&amp;G&#x2019;s traditional career path, in which managers on the rise usually moved to a different business every two years.<br><br>Over the course of those six years I did a number of things that P&amp;G didn&#x2019;t do then, beginning with putting together a small but diverse team. We had a Korean American woman, an African American woman, a white woman from Oregon who had previously been in the sales organization, and a white male engineer who had moved into marketing from manufacturing. The diversity of this group was remarkable not just for P&amp;G but for a mid-1980s management team in general.<br><br>I brought this team and our ad agency team, from Grey Advertising in New York, to meet the farmers who grew the peanuts for Jif on a contract basis. When we had a new ad campaign, I took the video or visuals to the factory in Lexington, Kentucky, and stayed there for twenty-four hours so that I could show them to all three shifts and get their feedback and input. And before it became the vogue, we did an unusual number of in-home visits and shop-alongs with moms.<br><br>These in-home visits and shop-alongs sharpened our sense of Jif&#x2019;s core customers from simply women between the ages of eighteen and thirty-four to highly engaged moms with children from toddler to early elementary school age. My guiding thought was that Jif should become the most loved peanut butter by exemplifying and supporting what these moms valued. So we had to have the highest quality and make sure there were no traces of carcinogenic aflatoxins, a toxin produced by mold, in the peanuts we used. We had to address moms&#x2019; concerns about healthfulness and nutrition in general. We had to have great taste that young kids loved.</p><h2>Fox Eyes</h2><p>A fox causes consternation among the animals whose secrets he discovers.

Hitler had declared that the Allied drive toward Rome must be stopped at all costs, and in the winter of 1943&#x2013;44 the German commander Kesselring chose the fortress-like monastery of Monte Cassino as the centerpiece of the Gustav Line, one of the most impressive feats of defensive engineering ever conceived. With months to prepare his position, Kesselring took advantage of the treacherous terrain to establish a virtually impregnable position. As the Allied forces?which included Americans, British, Canadians, Indians, South Africans, Tunisians, Algerians, Moroccans, Senegalese, Brazilians, and royalist Italians?pushed their way forward, the coldest, rainiest winter in Italian history rendered air and armor power useless, and turned the landscape into a hellish killing ground.<br><br><i>The Battle of Monte Cassino </i>is a story of the horrors of war seen from the perspective of the soldiers on the battlefield. Through interviews with hundreds of survivors, as well as wartime letters and diaries, Matthew Parker vividly captures the savagery of conflicts fought with grenades, bayonets, and bare hands. His extensive research in the military archives of the participating nations brings to light how incessant disagreements and backbiting at the Allied command level contributed to the carnage and confusion. The destruction of the fourteenth-century monastery itself becomes a powerful symbol of the toll war takes on history and culture. Monte Cassino was one of the most sacred sites in Christendom and the home to valuable religious artifacts, artworks, and manuscripts. In massive Allied bombings, the building and many of its irreplaceable treasures were reduced to rubble. <br><br>The first book in twenty years about Monte Cassino, this monumental work of history conveys the human face of war with authoritative power and unforgettable emotional resonance.</p></p><p><p><b>MATTHEW PARKER</b> is the author of <i>The Battle of Britain</i>. He is a writer and editor specializing in modern history, and lives in London, England.</p>1<br>The Casablanca Conference and the Invasion of Sicily<br>On 14 January 1943, Roosevelt and Churchill met in the newly liberated city of Casablanca in Morocco. In the East, the ring had closed around Stalingrad, and the Western Allied leaders now debated their next steps. With Churchill in the lavish surroundings of the Villa Mirador on the outskirts of the city was Gen. Sir Harold Alexander, later to be overall Allied commander at Cassino, whose "easy, smiling grace," Churchill wrote, "won all hearts." Harold Macmillan, then the British resident minister in North Africa, wrote of Churchill, "I have never seen him in finer form. He ate and drank enormously all the time, settled huge problems . . ." Officially, all were in agreement: With the campaign in Tunisia taking longer than expected, the cross-Channel invasion would be delayed until 1944. Once German resistance in North Africa had been ended, an invasion of Sicily would follow. If successful, this would give the Allies control of the Mediterranean, reopen the Gibraltar-Suez shipping lane and, they hoped, knock Italy out of the war.<br><br>Behind the outward shows of unity, however, lurked serious disagreements about strategy. In fact, the Casablanca Conference saw the stormiest negotiations ever to occur between the Western Allies. The Americans, observing the military dictum that an attacker should go the shortest route to his objective with the greatest strength he can muster, were deeply suspicious of further delays to the invasion of France. The staunchest holder of this line was Gen. George Marshall, the US Army chief of staff and Roosevelt's right-hand man as far as running the war was concerned. In his view the Mediterranean was a sideshow and an unnecessary drain on manpower and resources that could be better employed by returning immediately to England and then heading via the shortest route to Berlin. Churchill though, like all the British, haunted by the ghosts of the Western Front a generation earlier, was determined to delay the battle in northern France until success was far more assured. He didn't think that moment had come, and also had other motives for pushing forward in the Mediterranean. Traditionally a British concern because of the route to India, Churchill was also intent on "setting the Balkans alight"--exploiting the resistance to Nazi occupation that had already tied down vital German divisions and aiming to cut supplies of oil and other products essential to Germany's war machine. He was even far-sighted enough to wish to get Western Allied soldiers into Central Europe and especially Greece before the Red Army arrived.<br><br>Exasperated by British reluctance to proceed full-steam-ahead with plans for the cross-Channel invasion, the Americans were suspicious that Churchill's Mediterranean ambitions were motivated by imperial interests. There had been tension between Britain and America between the wars, including fierce exchanges over Britain's economic policy of Imperial Preference, which damaged US trade, and the American leadership could be absolutely sure of its people's deeply held anticolonialism. For Churchill, though, the empire was not up for discussion.<br><br>But at Casablanca the British, much to their surprise, got their way, and after ten days of heated negotiation a compromise was reached that prepared the invasion of Sicily. This, as will be seen, led almost inadvertently to the major struggle in Italy, and the Americans retained the impression that they had been duped, or "led down the garden path" as far as Southern Europe was concerned.<br><br>The ramifications of the Casablanca Conference were to affect the whole of the Italian campaign. To a great extent, at the highest level the Americans were unwilling participants in Churchill's "Mediterranean adventure." This made the southern theater a low priority for supplies and manpower, and also fed the distrust and dislike between the two principal allies, which was to reach its grim conclusion at Monte Cassino.<br>The road that leads to the climactic battles south of Rome in early 1944 starts with the decision taken nearly two years earlier in July 1942 to commit sizable American and British resources to North Africa. It had been agreed that there were not enough specialized landing craft for a cross-Channel invasion that year. There were also insufficient US forces already trained and shipped to Europe. Instead of letting what forces there were stagnate, it was thought best to use them to clear North Africa and thus do at least something on land to help the hard-pressed Soviets. President Roosevelt was determined that there should be American troops fighting the Germans somewhere as soon as possible. So in November 1942, against the wishes of the US military leaders, the president gave the go-ahead for Operation Torch; landings by American and British troops along the northwest coast of Africa. General Sir Bernard Montgomery's 8th Army, following its victory at El Alamein the previous month, attacked from the east.<br><br>The deep misgivings of the British about the unreadiness of the Allied forces for an attack on the well-defended northern French coast proved justified when in December 1942 the 8th Army was checked by the outnumbered Afrika Korps. In early February 1943, Rommel, briefly back in charge of the German forces in Africa, counterattacked American units near the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia. Initially the attack was held, but soon rumors began to sweep through the American ranks, and some units started retreating without having been given the order to do so. Exhausted and demoralized, and weak from days of fighting in the mountains without water, it was for many of the American soldiers their first taste of being dive-bombed and mortared. The result was a panic-stricken retreat that saw the Germans push back their attackers for over fifty miles. For the British, it was upsetting confirmation of their suspicions about the fighting ability of their ally. General Alexander, then second-in-command in the theater, wrote to Gen. Sir Alan Brooke, chief of the Imperial General Staff and effectively Britain's most senior soldier, calling the GIs "soft, green and quite untrained . . . is it surprising they lack the will to fight? . . . If this handful of divisions here are their best, the value of the rest may be imagined." The breakthrough at Kasserine was not exploited, but German reinforcements continued to arrive in Tunisia.<br><br>This move was evidence of a new German confidence in the early spring of 1943. To the dismay of the Red Army, the Wehrmacht had made a startling recovery after the disaster of Stalingrad the previous winter. In March 1943 the Soviets were driven back in places by a hundred miles when the Germans counterattacked around Kharkov in the Ukraine. In addition to this success, new weapons were coming through, including Tiger heavy tanks and Panther heavy-medium tanks. A massive manpower mobilization using slave labor had freed thousands of Germans for military service, and the Wehrmacht was now close to its size of two years earlier in spite of the enormous losses on the Eastern Front. Germany's increasingly unwilling allies--Italy, Finland, Hungary, and Romania--had been kept in the war, and another great offensive was planned for May around Kursk. Submarine production was up and it was hoped that offensives against the West at sea and the East on land would see Germany through until the unlikely alliance between the United States/Britain and the Soviet Union fell apart.<br><br>Furthermore, even relations between the United States and Britain were strained. After the Casablanca Conference and the setback in the Kasserine Pass, the Americans persisted in their suspicions that they had been hoodwinked into an expensive sideshow, and the British remained fearful that their ally would pull the plug on the Mediterranean theater, or, even worse, go back on the Germany First policy and transfer the bulk of their forces to fight Japan. Events on the ground had also led to distrust on one side matched by resentment on the other. President Roosevelt himself complained that the British had relegated American units to supporting roles, unwilling to trust them with anything else. In fact, the performance of the American II Corps in Africa improved markedly as the soldiers and commanders gained experience and received training from British troops. As Gen. Omar Bradley, II Corps' commander, commented after the war, Tunisia was an important testing ground. "In Africa," he wrote, "we learned to crawl, to walk--then run." By 3 March, the ground lost in Rommel's February counterattack had been recaptured, and at the end of the month General Patton's American divisions met up with Montgomery's 8th Army, which had at last broken through the German defensive lines in southern Tunisia. Alexander then reorganized the Allied armies and ordered a general offensive to start on 4 May. By then German supply lines to their army in Tunisia were under constant attack, and it was decided in Berlin to abandon the Afrika Korps, now commanded by Gen. Jurgen von Arnim. Three days later Bizerte and Tunis were captured, and on 12 May a message was intercepted by the Allies from von Arnim: "We have fired our last cartridge. We are closing down for ever." By the next day, all Axis forces in North Africa had surrendered. In all, some 130,000 German and 120,000 Italian prisoners were taken. Notes made by an Allied cameraman recording the capitulation maintain that the lines of prisoners stretched for twenty-two kilometers. By any standards, it was a spectacular victory for the Allies.<br><br>The front line was now the Sicilian Channel, and, as agreed at Casablanca, preparations started for an assault on the island. There was considerable nervousness about what was to be the Allies' first major amphibious landing on an enemy-held coast, and Britain's first return to Europe since its ignominious expulsion from Greece and Crete in 1941. Unlike the North African landings, when the invader...</p><h2>My Life with the Walter Boys</h2><p><p><strong>Jackie Howard has always been prim, proper, and perfect.

It's crazy, I know, because what sixteen-year-old girl doesn't have at least one pair, maybe with a tear in the left knee or a heart doodled across the thigh in Sharpie?</p> <p>It wasn't that I disliked the way they looked, and it had nothing to do with the fact that my mother had been a fashion designer, especially considering that she used jeans in her collections all the time. But I was a firm believer in the phrase "dress to impress," and today I was definitely going to need to make an impression.</p> <p>"Jackie?" I heard Katherine call from somewhere inside the apartment. "The taxi is here."</p> <p>"Just a minute!" I scooped a piece of paper off my desk. "Laptop, charger, mouse," I muttered, reading off the rest of the checklist. Opening my satchel, I searched for my possessions to make sure they were safely tucked inside. "Check, check, check," I whispered when my fingers brushed against all three things. With a bright red pen, I marked an X next to each of them on my list.</p> <p>There was a knock on my bedroom door. "You ready, honey?" Katherine asked, poking her head inside. She was a tall woman in her late forties, with golden hair that was cut into a mom bob and starting to gray.</p> <p>"I think so," I told her, but my voice cracked, revealing otherwise. My gaze snapped down to my feet because I didn't want to see the look in her eyes-the sympathetic one that I'd seen on everyone's faces since the funeral.</p> <p>"I'll give you a moment," I heard her say.</p> <p>When the door clicked shut, I smoothed down my skirt as I glanced in the mirror. My long, dark curls were straightened and tied back with a blue ribbon like always, not a single strand out of place. The collar on my blouse was crooked, and I fidgeted with it until my reflection was seamless. I pursed my lips in annoyance at the purple circles under my eyes, but there was nothing I could do to fix the lack of sleep that was causing them.</p> <p>Sighing, I took one last look around my room. Even though my entire checklist was crossed off, I didn't know when I would be returning, and I didn't want to forget anything important. The space was strangely empty, since most of my possessions were on a moving truck bound for Colorado. It had taken me a week to pack it all, but Katherine had helped me with the huge task.</p> <p>Clothing had filled most of the boxes, but there were also my collection of Shakespeare plays and the teacups my sister, Lucy, and I had collected from every country we had ever visited. As I glanced around, I knew I was stalling; with my organizational skills, there was no way I'd forget anything. The real issue was that I didn't want to leave New York-not one bit.</p> <p>But I didn't have a say in the matter, so with reluctance I grabbed my carry-on. Katherine was waiting for me out in the hall, one small suitcase sitting at her feet.</p> <p>"Have everything?" she asked, and I nodded my head. "All right, let's get going then."</p> <p>She led the way through the living room and toward the front door, and I trailed slowly behind her, running my hands over the furniture in an attempt to memorize every last detail of my home. It was hard, which was strange considering I'd lived here my entire life. The white sheets thrown over the furniture so dust wouldn't frost the fabric were like solid walls, holding my recollections at bay.</p> <p>We stepped out of the apartment in silence, and Katherine paused to lock the door. "Would you like to look after the key?" she asked.</p> <p>I had my own set tucked in my suitcase, but I reached out and took the small silver piece of metal from her hands. Unfastening my mother's locket, I let the key slip down the delicate chain so it could rest against my chest, right next to my heart.</p> <p>***</p> <p>We sat on the plane in silence. I was trying hard to forget that I was currently moving farther and farther away from my home, and I refused to let myself cry. For the first month after the accident, I never left my bed. Then came the day where I miraculously pulled myself out from underneath my comforter and got dressed. Since then, I'd promised myself that I would be strong and composed. I didn't want to go back to that weak, hollow person I'd become, and that wasn't going to change now. Instead, I focused my attention on Katherine as she clenched and unclenched the armrest, her knuckles going white each time she did.</p> <p>I only knew a few things about the woman sitting next to me. First was that she was my mother's childhood friend. They grew up in New York and attended Hawks Boarding School together, the same school my sister and I had been enrolled in. Back then, she was known as Katherine Green, which brought me to the second thing I knew about her. During college she met George Walter. The two married and moved to Colorado to start a horse ranch, George's lifelong dream. Finally, the third and most noteworthy piece of information I knew about Katherine-she was my new guardian. Apparently I'd met her when I was little, but it was so long ago that I couldn't remember. Katherine Walter was a complete stranger to me.</p> <p>"Afraid of flying?" I asked, as she let out a deep breath. Honestly, the woman looked like she was going to be sick.</p> <p>"No, but to be completely truthful, I am a bit nervous about-well, taking you home," she said. I felt my shoulders tense up. Was she afraid that I was going to go off the deep end? I could assure her that wasn't going to happen, not if I wanted to get into Princeton. Uncle Richard must have said something to her, something about me not being okay, even though I was perfectly fine. Katherine caught my look and quickly added, "Oh no, not because of you, honey. I know you're a good kid."</p> <p>"Then why?"</p> <p>Katherine's smile was sympathetic. "Jackie, honey, did I ever tell you I have twelve kids?"</p> <p>No, I thought as my mouth dropped open, that definitely wasn't mentioned. When he decided that I was moving to Colorado, Uncle Richard did say something about Katherine having kids, but twelve? He'd conveniently left that little detail out. A dozen kids. Katherine's household must be stuck permanently in a state of chaos. Why would anyone even want to have twelve children? I could feel the tiny wings of panic fluttering inside my chest.</p> <p>Stop overreacting, I told myself. After taking a few deep breaths in through the nose and out through the mouth, I pulled out a notebook and pen. I needed to find out as much as I could about the family I was going to live with, so I could be prepared. Sitting up in my seat, I asked Katherine to tell me about her kids and she agreed enthusiastically.</p> <p>"My oldest is Will," she began, and I started writing.</p> <p>The Walter Boys:</p> <p>Will is twenty-one. He's in his final semester at the local community college and is engaged to his high-school sweetheart.</p> <p>Cole is seventeen. He's a senior in high school and a talented auto mechanic.</p> <p>Danny is seventeen. He's also a senior in high school and the president of the drama club. He's Cole's fraternal twin.</p> <p>Isaac is sixteen. He's a junior in high school and is obsessed with girls. He's Katherine's nephew.</p> <p>Alex is sixteen. He's a sophomore in high school and plays way too many video games.</p> <p>Lee is fifteen. He's a sophomore in high school and a skater. He's also Katherine's nephew.</p> <p>Nathan is fourteen. He's a freshman in high school and a musician.</p> <p>Jack and Jordan are twelve. They're in seventh grade and twins. They believe that they will be the next Steven Spielberg and always have a video camera with them.</p> <p>Parker is nine. He's in fourth grade. He looks innocent but loves tackle football.</p> <p>Zack and Benny are five and are in kindergarten. They're twins and crazy little monsters with potty mouths.</p> <p>I looked over what I wrote, and my stomach dropped. This was a joke, right? Katherine didn't just have twelve kids, but twelve boys! I knew nothing, absolutely nothing, about the male species. I went to a private school for girls! How was I ever going to survive living in a house full of boys? Didn't they speak their own language or something?</p> <p>As soon as the plane landed, Uncle Richard was going to hear an earful from me. Knowing him, he was probably wrapped up in an important board meeting and wouldn't be able to take my call, but I couldn't believe him! Not only was he pawning me off on some woman I didn't know, but he also was dumping me with a pack of boys. He said he was doing what was best for me, especially since he was never home, but over the past three months, I'd gotten the feeling that he just didn't feel comfortable being a parent.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Richard wasn't my real uncle, but I'd known him since I was a little girl. He was my dad's college roommate, and after graduating, they became business partners. Every year on my birthday, he would bring me a bag of my favorite jellybeans and a card with fifty dollars in it.</p> <p>In January, Richard became my guardian, and to make the situation more bearable for me, he moved into the penthouse on the Upper East Side where my family lived. At first it was weird with him in the house, but he kept to himself in the spare bedroom and soon we fell into a comfortable routine. Normally, I only saw him at breakfast since he always worked late into the night, but last week that all changed. When I came home from school, the dinner table was set with what must have been his best attempt at a home-cooked meal. Then he told me I was moving to Colorado.</p> <p>"I don't get why you're making me leave," I told him after ten minutes of arguing.</p> <p>"I explained this already, Jackie," he said, his face pained as if this decision was ripping him away from the only home he'd ever known and not me. "Your school therapist is worried about you. She called today because she doesn't think you're coping well."</p> <p>"First of all, I never wanted to see that stupid therapist," I argued, slamming my fork on the table. "Secondly, how can she even suggest I'm not coping well? My grades are excellent, if not better than first semester."</p> <p>"You've done a fine job in school, Jackie," he said. I could hear the but coming. "However, she thinks that you're throwing yourself into your work as a way to avoid facing your problems."</p> <p>"My only problem is that she has no clue who I am! Come on, Uncle Richard. You know me. I've always been studious and hardworking. That's what it means to be a Howard."</p> <p>"Jackie, you've joined three new clubs since the start of the semester. Don't you think you're spreading yourself a bit thin?"</p> <p>"Did you know that Sarah Yolden received a scholarship to go study an endangered species of plants in Brazil over the summer?" I asked instead.</p> <p>"No, but-"</p> <p>"She got to publish her findings in a science magazine. She's also first chair for violin and got to perform in Carnegie Hall. How am I supposed to compete with that? I can't just have good grades if I want to get into Princeton," I told him coolly. "My application needs to be impressive. I'm building it up."</p> <p>"And I understand that, but I also think a change of scenery might be beneficial for you. The Walters are wonderful people and are happy to take you in."</p> <p>"A change of scenery is relaxing on the beach for a week!" I exclaimed, rocketing out of my seat. Leaning over the table, I glared at Uncle Richard. "This is cruel. You're sending me across the country."</p> <p>He sighed. "I know you don't understand right now, Jackie, but I promise this is a good thing. You'll see."</p> <p>***</p> <p>So far, I still didn't understand. The closer we got to Colorado, the more nervous I became, and no matter how many times I told myself that things would be fine, I didn't believe it. I chewed my lip until it was raw, worrying over how difficult it would be for me to fit into the Walters' lives.</p> <p>When the plane landed, Katherine and I made our way through the airport to find her husband.</p> <p>"Now, I told the kids last week that you're moving in, so they know you're coming," she chattered as we pushed through the crowds. "Also, I have a room for you. I just haven't been able to clean it out yet, so-oh, George! George, over here!"</p> <p>Katherine jumped up and down, waving to a tall man in his early fifties. I could tell Mr. Walter was a few years older than his wife because most of his hair and scruff were completely gray, and age lines were starting to streak across his forehead. He was wearing a red-and-black flannel shirt with ripped jeans, heavy work boots, and a cowboy hat.</p> <p>When we reached him, he pulled Katherine into a hug and stroked her hair. It reminded me of my parents, and I cringed and turned away. "I missed you," he told her.</p> <p>She pecked him on the cheek. "I missed you too." Pulling away, she turned to me. "George dear," she said, taking his hand. "This is Jackie Howard. Jackie, this is my husband."</p> <p>George looked uncomfortable as he sized me up. After all, how exactly do you greet someone who just lost her entire family? Nice to meet you? We're happy to have you? Instead, George held out his free hand for me to grasp and muttered a quick hello.</p> <p>Then he turned back to Katherine. "Let's get the luggage and go home."</p> <p>***</p> <p>Once all of my suitcases were packed into the bed of the truck, I climbed in the backseat and dug my iPod out of my jacket. George and Katherine were chatting quietly about the flight, so I pulled on my headphones, not wanting to hear any more of their conversation. As we drove farther away from the city and deeper into the country, I became more upset. We were surrounded by green fields and hills that dipped up and down along the pavement, but without the tall, proud buildings of New York City, I somehow felt exposed. Colorado was beautiful, but how was I ever going to live here?</p> <p>Finally, after what seemed like hours, the truck pulled onto a gravel road. In the distance, I could see a house at the top of a hill, but just barely. Was all of this land really theirs? When we got to the top, I realized that it wasn't a single house; it looked more like three homes put together. I guess you need a lot of space for twelve boys.</p> <p>The grass desperately needed to be mowed, and the wooden front porch could have used a paint job. The lawn was covered in toys, probably the younger boys' handiwork. George hit one of those small clicker-thingies that was clipped onto the visor, and the garage door started to open. A bike fell over, followed by a few more toys, which blocked the truck's way into the parking spot.</p> <p>"How many times do we need to tell them to clean up after themselves?" George grumbled to himself.</p> <p>"Don't worry, dear. I'm on it," Katherine said as she unbuckled her seat belt and slid out of the car. I watched as she moved the mess so her husband could pull in. When the car was finally parked, George let the engine die, and we sat in the dim silence. Then, he turned around in the front seat to face me.</p> <p>"You ready, Jackie?" he asked. He looked me over and frowned. "You're looking kind of pale."</p> <p>Of course I looked pale! I had just flown halfway across the country with a woman I didn't know because my family was gone. On top of that, I was going to have to live with twelve kids, all of whom were b...</p></p><h2>Half-Sun on the Columbia: A Biography of Chief Moses (Volume 80) (The Civilization of the American Indian Series)</h2><p>Chief Moses (Sulktalthscosum or Half-Sun) was chief of the Columbias, a Salish-speaking people of the mid&#x2013;Columbia River area in what is now the state of Washington. This award-winning biography by Robert H. Ruby and John A. Brown situates Moses in the opening of the Northwest and subsequent Indian-white relations, between 1850 and 1898. Early in life Moses had won a name for himself battling whites, but with the maturity and responsibilities of chieftainship, he became a diplomat and held his united tribe at peace in spite of growing white encroachment. He resisted the call to arms of his friend Chief Joseph of the Nez Perc�s, whose heroic campaign ended in defeat and exile to Indian Territory. Yet their friendship persisted, and after Joseph's return to the Northwest, the two lived out their lives on the reservation, sharing their frustrations and uniting their voices in complaint.</p><p><p> <b>Robert H.

It&#x2019;s like Masonry, but without the secret handshakes. </p><p> Grafton reveals the microdynamics of the scholarly life through a series of essays on institutions and on scholars ranging from early modern polymaths to modern intellectual historians to American thinkers and writers. He takes as his starting point the republic of letters&#x2014;that loose society of intellectuals that first took shape in the sixteenth century and continued into the eighteenth. Its inhabitants were highly original, individual thinkers and writers. Yet as Grafton shows, they were all formed, in some way, by the very groups and disciplines that they set out to build. </p><p> In our noisy, caffeinated world it has never been more challenging to be a scholar. When many of our fellow citizens seem to have forgotten why we collect books in the buildings we call libraries, Grafton&#x2019;s engaging, erudite essays could be a rallying cry for the revival of the liberal arts. </p></p><p>Anthony Grafton is Henry Putnam University Professor of History at Princeton University.Grafton challenges readers to consider the pursuit of scholarship in the twenty-first century by reflecting on its practices and practitioners--from the libraries of the Renaissance to the classrooms of the late nineteenth and twentieth-century universities to the virtual spaces where minds and worlds meet today.

He takes his readers on a long journey, from the Republic of Letters to the Babel of the Internet. If it is hard to say whether or not the road leads upward to the light, there is no doubt that we could not ask for anyone wiser to lead us. Like Dante's Virgil, Grafton knows everyone we meet along the way.<br> --G. W. Bowersock (<i>New York Review of Books</i> 2009-05-14)<br><br>Mr. Grafton may be steeped in the past, but he is no antiquarian. He is quick to link submerged traditions with present trends. He regards recent developments in technology, and their effects on libraries and on reading, as both a blessing and a burden. Ideally, new technologies don't displace old ones; they augment them. Cuneiform tablets, papyri, manuscripts, as well as books, remain essential to scholarship and to learning at large, if only because the look and feel of the past can be as important as its content. The larger, more troubling question is: Who will read them in the future? Sometimes Mr. Grafton sounds an elegiac note; he laments "the dull, provincial scholarship of our own sad time." He may be right to do so. Nevertheless, he himself represents the best proof that the Republic of Letters is alive and kicking.<br> --Eric Ormsby (<i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2009-03-13)<br><br>Some of the best and most vivid writing in this new book evokes the ambience, patrons and "smells of dust and noble rot," in havens ranging from the Bodleian to the old British Library Reading Room, from the Biblioth�que nationale in Paris ("a building that looks like the set from some forgotten dystopian sci-fi film of the 1970s") to the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, each with its own unique character and perspective...It is from that traditional vantage point that Grafton, Renaissance scholar extraordinaire, has, for the past forty years or so, dispassionately and indefatigably investigated the intellectual activities of the great early humanists.<br> --Peter Green (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2009-07-17)<br><br>Grafton's essays dance nimbly across that gigantic chasm of time separating the Renaissance from Google...<i>Worlds Made by Words</i> amounts to a tour of Renaissance scholarship conducted by someone with a deep understanding of our own moment in the history of reading.

Grafton, a scholar fully at home in that world, offers his type of intellectual history that never lets the grand flow of ideas hide the fullness of life, including the lives of the creative scholars. These brilliant but often flawed individuals became shapers of worlds made of words (critically assessed worlds of thought). Although he does not hide practices motivated by corruption and vainglory, Grafton elucidates lovingly the characteristics of their inquiries: erudition, audacious criticism and creativity, insistence on perfect use of language (for a long time, Latin), and a wide range of inquiries well beyond that possible for modern individual scholars. Grafton exhibits many of the admirable qualities in his own research for and writing of these essays. Even his assessment of the digital world's impact on the world of learning Grafton so admires is sharply critical and tinged with sadness, but shows a balanced judgment. Readers get a fascinating introduction to a true world of learning.<br> --E. A.

The weaving tradition still flourishes, and the examples illustrated here provide a revealing insight to African culture and traditions.</p><p>Christopher Spring is Curator of the African Collection at the Museum of Mankind, in the Ethnography Department of the British Museum, London.</p><h2>Big Momma Makes the World (BOSTON GLOBEHORN BOOK AWARDS (AWARDS))</h2><p><b>Powerful, warm, and utterly original, this no-nonsense tall tale of Big Momma the creator is a jubilant celebration of our beautiful world - and a reminder to take good care of it.<br></b><br><br>"Earth," said Big Momma, "Get over here."<br> And it did.<br> All one big ball of mud it was,<br> nothing much to look at.<br> Baby liked it all right just the way it was,<br> but Big Momma wasn&#x2019;t finished yet.<br><br>When Big Momma makes the world, she doesn&#x2019;t mess around. With a little baby on her hip and laundry piling up, she demands light and dark, earth and sky, creepers and crawlers, and lots of folks to trade stories with on the front porch. And when the work is done, Big Momma, she is pleased all right. "That&#x2019;s good," she says. "That&#x2019;s real good."<br><br>With down-home language and infectious rhythms, storyteller Phyllis Root spins a creation myth like no other, brilliantly illustrated by the incomparable Helen Oxenbury.</p><p>Phyllis Root has written many books for children, including Oliver Finds His Way, What Baby Wants, Rattletrap Car, and Kiss the Cow! She says that the idea for Big Momma Makes the World came from a long-ago family car trip through the West. "My children were restless, yet fascinated by the unfamiliar scenery. They made up stories about why the landscape looked the way it did, and God and a baby were in lots of the stories." Phyllis Root lives in Minnesota with her two daughters.<br><br>Helen Oxenbury is one of today&#x2019;s most acclaimed illustrators. Among her books are Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND, which won a Kate Greenaway Medal; Trish Cooke&#x2019;s SO MUCH; Martin Waddell&#x2019;s FARMER DUCK; and Michael Rosen&#x2019;s WE'RE GOING ON A BEAR HUNT. She says of working on BIG MOMMA MAKES THE WORLD, "As I read Phyllis&#x2019;s text, I imagined Big Momma as part Buddha, part housewife. . . . It was intimidating to create a whole world, but very enjoyable."PreS-Gr. 2. A raucous, joyous version of the creation story starring a big, bossy woman who knows what she wants and how to get it: "When Big Momma made the world, she didn't mess around." Down in the infinite water, her naked little baby on her hip, she sees what needs to be done: "Light," says Big Momma. "And you'd better believe there was light." She also creates dark on the first day, and for the next five days she's one busy lady. Sky, sun, moon, earth, flora, and fauna--there's so much to do, and after she does it, Big Momma always says approvingly, "That's good. That's real good." On the seventh day she rests, leaving the world to its own devices, though sometimes she looks down and tells her final creation--humans--that they'd "better straighten up." Sometimes, when she and baby look down, they like what they see. Root's text is strong and sassy, with a down-home cadence that has immediate appeal, and Oxenbury's Big Momma is the perfect embodiment of the story's earth mother--no particular race or color, just full of affection and determination. Some of the pictures are wonderful (a double-page spread of animals bursting out of the sun); some, such as the one of modern-day humans looking up at the sky, are more mundane. Yet overall, this is an exciting, new version of one of the world's oldest stories. And the baby is pretty cute, too. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Stevens&#x2019;s daughter, Andrea, is distraught over a classmate&#x2019;s suicide, but what the two investigators find is even more disturbing&#x2014;an online suicide club of unhappy teenagers, presided over by an anonymous presence who seems to be spurring them on. Soon, it becomes apparent that the classmate wasn&#x2019;t the first victim&#x2014;and won&#x2019;t be the last, either, unless they can hunt down this psychopath once and for all.</p><p><b>Owen Laukkanen</b> was born in Vancouver. After graduating from university in 2006, he answered an ad on Craigslist for a summer job at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas as a &#x201c;poker tournament reporter&#x201d; for a poker website. At the end of the summer, they offered him a full-time job. You wouldn&#x2019;t think you could make a living at this, but you would be wrong. For the next three years he traveled around the world, reporting from the most luxurious casinos of Monaco and Macau and Australia to the sketchiest card rooms of California and Atlantic City. In 2009, having seen his fill, Laukkanen quit to concentrate on fiction. He also spends summers as a deckhand on the boats of his father and his uncle, both commercial fishermen. He is at work on more novels.<br> &nbsp;<br> His previous Stevens and Windermere novels are <i>The Professionals</i>, <i>Criminal Enterprise</i>, <i>Kill Fee</i>, and <i>The Stolen Ones</i>. <i>The Professionals</i> was nominated for the Barry Award and International Thriller Writers Award for best first novel, as well as the <i>Spinetingler</i> Award for Best Novel: New Voice. <i>Criminal Enterprise</i> was nominated for the ITW Award for best novel. Both books, as well as <i>Kill Fee</i>, appeared on several best-of-the-year lists.It was time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adrian Miller had planned to wait, a few more days, another week, maybe. Hell, when he woke up in the morning, before class, he wasn&#x2019;t even sure he would do it anymore. He&#x2019;d thought about his mom and dad and sister, about Lucas, and wondered what kind of monster would want to hurt them the way he was planning. He&#x2019;d hugged his parents goodbye and walked out the front door, and it was a beautiful fall morning, crisp and bracing and clear, and he&#x2019;d decided, not yet. Maybe not ever.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then he showed up at school, and it all started again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucas wouldn&#x2019;t talk to him. Lucas <i>never</i> talked to him, not in public anyway. Lucas avoided his looks in the hallway, wouldn&#x2019;t eat lunch with him, made him wait until the final bell rang and they could go away to the park somewhere, or Lucas&#x2019;s dad&#x2019;s basement, somewhere far away from school and Lucas&#x2019;s real friends.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, though, Lucas acted even more distant. Wouldn&#x2019;t even answer his texts. Laughed along with his friends when they mocked him in math class. When someone poured water on his seat, so when he sat down it looked like he&#x2019;d pissed himself. He&#x2019;d looked over at the jocks in the corner, Lucas among them, all of them pointing and laughing and losing their minds, snapping pictures to upload to Facebook. Lucas was laughing with them. Lucas didn&#x2019;t even have the courtesy to look away when he looked over. Even when he caught Lucas&#x2019;s eye, like, <i>what the hell, man?</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>Like, <i>I thought you were my friend.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>The pictures showed up online around lunchtime. Followed him around for the rest of the day. By the time the final bell rang, he&#x2019;d forgotten how happy he&#x2019;d felt this morning. He&#x2019;d remembered why he wanted to do it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now it was time.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was alone in the house. His parents wouldn&#x2019;t be home for another couple of hours, at least. His little sister was off with her friends. He set his backpack on the bed and opened up his laptop, heard the chime from a hundred and one Facebook notifications.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Fag.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loser.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fucking skid.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He opened a new window in his browser. Logged on to the website he visited most. Found Ambriel98 and opened a chat window.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I think I&#x2019;m ready. I think I&#x2019;m going to do it today.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>A long pause. He pictured Ambriel on the other side of the screen, staring into her own laptop somewhere in Pennsylvania. Wondered if she&#x2019;d try and stop him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>It&#x2019;s the right decision</i>, she typed. <i>U&#x2019;ll be in a better place.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least I won&#x2019;t be in this place, </i>he replied.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>I wish I had your balls.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He kind of laughed, despite himself. <i>Take them.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn your webcam on if you&#x2019;re doing it, </i>she typed. <i>Like we talked about. You&#x2019;ll inspire me. You&#x2019;ll inspire so many people like us.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>He looked around his room. Wondered if he was really ready to do this. Heard the chime from Facebook again, another asshole he couldn&#x2019;t avoid, even in his own bedroom. Pictured going through another year of this shit, graduating, and then what?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More shit, probably.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More assholes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never any escape.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He dug into the bottom drawer of his desk. Pulled out the bottle he&#x2019;d stolen from his dad, uncapped it and took a drink. Grimaced at the burn. Then he turned back to his laptop. Screw it. He was ready.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Get ready for the show</i>, he told Ambriel as he switched on his webcam. <i>See you on the other side.</i><br><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>TWO</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The phone wouldn&#x2019;t stop ringing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carla Windermere looked up from her computer, irritated. Looked across the small office to her partner&#x2019;s empty workstation, then out into the hall and the Criminal Investigative Division beyond. Kirk Stevens had disappeared somewhere, and he&#x2019;d left his dinky old cell phone behind.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windermere pushed herself out of her chair, crossed to Stevens&#x2019;s desk, where the cell phone kept bleating its tinny electronic ring tone. She snatched up the phone, walked out to the doorway and scanned CID, fully intending to give her partner a lecture about the merits of his handset&#x2019;s &#x201c;silent&#x201d; feature. But there was no sign of Stevens anywhere.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windermere was still getting used to the whole partner thing. She&#x2019;d worked with Stevens, a special agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, on a number of high profile cases during her four years in the FBI&#x2019;s Minneapolis office. She liked the man, a twenty-year cop with sharp instincts and a steady aim, figured they worked well together&#x2014;and history proved it. But when their bosses had decided to put them together onto a joint FBI-BCA violent crimes taskforce, they&#x2019;d shunted Stevens into the FBI building, given him an office with Windermere. And Windermere still wasn&#x2019;t sure how she felt about sharing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still clutching the phone, Windermere walked deeper into the CID bullpen, splitting the rows of cubicles until she came to Derek Mathers&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Seen Stevens?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mathers looked up from his computer, grinned when he saw her. He was a junior agent, a boyish, good-looking Wisconsin farm boy. He&#x2019;d also managed to thaw Windermere&#x2019;s heart enough that lately she was calling him her boyfriend, as much as the lovey-dovey stuff nauseated her.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Stevens? No idea,&#x201d; Mathers said. &#x201c;You try the kitchen?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone shut off. Stayed silent a moment. Then it started back up again. Around CID, people poked their heads up from their cubicles. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I swear, the bastard&#x2019;s doing this to piss me off,&#x201d; Windermere told him.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens was just replacing the coffee pot when she walked into the break room. &#x201c;Carla,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You want coffee? Fresh pot.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I swear to god, Stevens, if this thing keeps ringing, I&#x2019;m going to answer it myself,&#x201d; she said, brandishing the phone. &#x201c;And I can&#x2019;t be held responsible for what happens next.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens made his eyes wide. Put down the pot and his coffee mug, crossed the break room to the door. &#x201c;Give it here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The last thing I need is you making friends with my wife.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took the phone, flipped it open. &#x201c;Agent Stevens,&#x201d; he said, ducking out into the hallway.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windermere savored the silence for a moment. Looked over at the coffee pot. <i>As long as I&#x2019;m here</i>. She poured herself a cup. Replaced the pot. Left the break room and found Stevens standing in the hall, staring at his phone, pale. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You okay?&#x201d; she asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens glanced at her. &#x201c;That was Andrea,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;There was an incident at her school; I have to go get her. One of her classmates, uh.&#x201d; He shook his head. &#x201c;Well, I guess he killed himself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windermere felt something twinge inside her, something small and tucked-away and long forgotten. &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;<i>Shit</i>, Stevens, that&#x2019;s awful.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Stevens said, still staring at the phone. &#x201c;Andrea&#x2019;s a mess,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I should&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Go,&#x201d; Windermere said. &#x201c;Definitely. Get out of here.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens nodded. Walked off down the hall like he was in a kind of a daze. Windermere watched him go, all the way back through CID to the bank of elevators on the far wall. Watched him until he&#x2019;d disappeared, and wondered why she wasn&#x2019;t moving.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>THREE</b><br> &nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;His name was Adrian Miller,&#x201d; Kirk Stevens told his wife. &#x201c;His parents found him in the bedroom when they got home from work yesterday. They figure he did it about as soon as he came home from school.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across the dining room table, Andrea Stevens wiped her eyes with a Kleenex. &#x201c;He was in my math class,&#x201d; she told her parents. &#x201c;Some asshole jocks from the football team poured water on his chair yesterday and took pictures of it when he sat down. It was all over Facebook.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She blew her nose. Glanced at her mom. &#x201c;Sorry for swearing,&#x201d; she said, quietly.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy Stevens waved her off. Dabbed at her own eyes. &#x201c;Kids can be so mean.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens nodded. Had nothing to say. He&#x2019;d driven to the school as soon as Andrea called, found her with her boyfriend and the rest of her classmates, the principal, and a couple of grief counselors besides. Three weeks into senior year, everybody still wearing the last of their summer tans, nobody prepared for this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&#x2019;d called his wife at the law office, and she picked up JJ, the Stevens&#x2019;s twelve-year-old son, brought everyone back home for a family day.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He was just a quiet kid,&#x201d; Andrea said. &#x201c;He always dressed kind of funny, and he didn&#x2019;t have any friends. He was a nice guy, though. There was nothing <i>wrong</i> with him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t he have any friends?&#x201d; JJ asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Andrea said. &#x201c;People were always picking on him, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d; Her face seemed to crumple, and she hid her face in her hands. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all just so <i>stupid</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>You got that right</i>, Stevens thought. He&#x2019;d dealt with plenty of different kinds of cruelty during his career as a BCA investigator, but the ways kids had of tormenting each other still made his stomach turn. Andrea, smart and athletic and popular, had managed to avoid the worst of the bullying, thank God. But JJ would be starting high school soon enough, and who could say how his classmates would treat him?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrea looked up from her hands. &#x201c;You have to do something, Dad,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;For Adrian. You have to make it so the people who did this to him have to pay.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens swapped glances with his wife. Leaned in and met his daughter&#x2019;s eyes. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if there&#x2019;s anything I <i>can</i> do, Ange,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;This kind of thing, it&#x2019;s probably too late to solve anything. There&#x2019;s not really any point in mucking people around.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a cop,&#x201d; Andrea said. &#x201c;Adrian&#x2019;s <i>dead</i>. Aren&#x2019;t you supposed to punish the responsible parties?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy rubbed Andrea&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;He can&#x2019;t just arrest all those jocks, honey,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It wouldn&#x2019;t solve anything, anyway. It&#x2019;s not going to bring Adrian back, no matter who gets arrested.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Andrea stifled a sob. &#x201c;You have to do <i>something</i>, Dad. You can&#x2019;t just let people get away with this.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stevens studied his daughter across the table, her fierce eyes. <i>She has her mom&#x2019;s sense of justice</i>, he thought. <i>Always fighting for the underdog</i>. It was the quality he admired most in his wife, a brilliant law mind who&#x2019;d turned her back on a comfortable salary to work Legal Aid for the city&#x2019;s downtrodden. It warmed Stevens&#x2019;s heart to know his daughter had inherited the same passion.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Let me see what I can do,&#x201d; he told Andrea. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t promise it&#x2019;ll make you feel any better, but maybe I can make a few calls.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br><br> <b>FOUR</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Windermere tried to get back to work after Stevens had gone. She had a whole pile of paperwork to process, the last hoops to jump through on a sex-trafficking case she and Stevens had closed during the summer. Had all afternoon to work on it, her office blissfully free of any distractions, any annoying ring tones, but somehow, the work didn&#x2019;t get done.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing,&#x201d; she told Mathers, at dinner that night. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Derek. No big deal.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They&#x2019;d gone back to her condo in downtown Minneapolis, as usual.

Indeed, reading the book is an excellent course in studying and expounding narrative literature."<br>--<b>Van Campbell</b>, <i>Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society <p></p></i>"Ross has written an excellent study guide to Genesis. His prodigious book, which he refrains from calling a commentary, contains fine scholarship and an excellent survey of previous work on this first book of the Bible. His writing is so interesting that the book became for me more than a source; it became bedside reading material. . . . Ross aims this detailed and lengthy study of Genesis at pastors, teachers, and seminary students who seek to develop an understanding of Genesis and narrative literature in general. He succeeds admirably. . . . For those preaching and writing on Genesis, and for those who love the book as great theology and literature, Ross's work is essential."<br>--<b>R. G.

But then Shalako came across a European hunting party, and a brave and beautiful woman, stranded and defenseless in the Sonoran Desert&#x2014;the Apaches&#x2019; killing ground. Shalako knew he had to stay and help them survive.

There are more than three hundred million copies of his books in print around the world.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>For seven days in the spring of 1882 the man called Shalako heard no sound but the wind . . .<br>No sound but the wind, the creak of his saddle, the hoofbeats of his horse.<br><br>Seven days riding the ghost trails up out of Sonora, down from the Sierra Madre, through Apache country, keeping off the skylines, and watching the beckoning fingers of the talking smoke.<br>Lean as a famine wolf but wide and thick in the shoulder, the man called Shalako was a brooding man, a wary man, a man who trusted to no fate, no predicted destiny, nor to any luck. He trusted to nothing but his weapons, his horse, and the caution with which he rode.<br><br>His hard-boned face was tanned to saddle leather under the beat-up, black, flat-crowned hat. He wore fringed shotgun chaps, a faded red shirt, a black handkerchief knotted about his throat, and a dozen scars of knife and bullet.<br><br>It was a baked and brutal land, this Sonora, sun-blistered and arid, yet as he sifted his way through the stands of organ-pipe cactus, prickly pear and cat's claw, he knew the desert throbbed with its own strange life, and he knew those slim fingers of lifting smoke beckoned death.<br><br>He was a lone-riding man in a lonesome country, riding toward a destiny of which he knew nothing, a man who for ten long years had known no other life than this, nor wished for any other.<br><br>What else there was he had known before, but now he lived from day to day, watching the lonely sunsets flame and die, bleeding their crimson shadows against the long, serrated ridges. Watching the dawns come, seeing the mornings stir with their first life . . . and the land he rode was a land where each living thing lived by the death of some other thing.<br><br>The desert was a school, a school where each day, each hour, a final examination was offered, where failure meant death and the buzzards landed to correct the papers.<br><br>For the desert holds no easy deaths . . . hard, bitter, and ugly are the desert deaths . . . and long drawn out.<br><br>Merciless were the raw-backed mountains, dreadfully desolate the canyons, the white-faced ancient lakes were dust . . . traps where a man might die, choking horribly upon alkali or the ashen powder of ancient rocks.<br><br>For seven days Shalako heard no sound but that of his own passage, and then a gunshot bought space in the silence, a harsh whiplash of sound, followed after an instant by the shattering volley of at least four rifles.<br><br>The rifles spoke again from the sounding board of the rocks, racketing away down the canyons to fade at the desert's rim.<br><br>Motionless upon a sun-baked slope, he waited while the sweat found thin furrows through the dust on his cheeks, but there was no further sound, no further shot, nor was there movement within the range of his vision . . . merely the lazy circle of a buzzard against the heat-blurred sky.<br><br>If they had not seen him already they would not see him if he remained still, and Shalako had learned his patience in a hard school.<br><br>Movement attracts the eye, draws the attention, renders visible. A motionless object that blends with the surroundings can long remain invisible even when close by, and Shalako was not moving.<br>About him lay vast, immeasurable distances, pastel shadings of salmon, pink, and lemon broken by the deeper reds of rock or the darkness of cliff shadow. Overhead the sun was lost in a copper sky above the heat-waved reaches where all sharpness of outline melted in the shimmering movement of the air.<br><br>The innocent distance that lay before him was broken by hollows, canyons, folded hills, but it seemed an even, unbroken expanse from where he sat. There were cholla forests out there, scatterings of lava . . . a land where anything might be and something obviously was.<br><br>The notch in the hills toward which he was pointing held a pass through the mountains, and within the pass lay a water hole.<br><br>His canteen was half-full and if necessity demanded it could be made to last another three days . . . it had done so before. In the desert a man learns to use water sparingly and to make a little cover a lot of distance.<br><br>The roan gelding was a mountain-bred horse and could survive on cholla or prickly pear if the spines were burned away, but water and grass lay within that opening in the hills, and Shalako had no intention of skirting the mountain unless circumstances insisted. Yet the sound of shots had come from that direction.<br><br>After a while he made, with sparing movements, a cigarette, his eyes holding on the far, blue mountains briefly, then surveying the country while he worked with the small, essential movements. He considered the possibilities, knowing that a desert offers less freedom of movement than at first seems likely. All travel in the desert, of man or animal, is governed by the need for water. Some animals learned to survive for days without water, but man was not one of these.<br><br>Four rifles . . . at least four rifles had fired that volley, and four rifles are not fired simultaneously unless fired at another man or men.<br><br>Sunset was scarcely an hour away, and the water hole was at least that far distant.<br><br>It was unlikely that whoever fired those shots would, at this hour, ride farther than the nearest water. Therefore the chances were that the water toward which he was riding would be occupied by whoever had done that shooting.<br><br>On the slope where he had drawn up neither the roan gelding nor himself would be visible at any distance, so he waited a little longer, inhaling deeply of the sharp, strong tobacco.<br><br>Four men do not fire in unison unless from ambush, and Shalako had no illusions about the sort of men who attack from concealment, nor what their attitude would be toward a drifting stranger who might have seen too much.<br><br>Whatever of gentleness lay within the man called Shalako was hidden behind the cold green eyes. There was no visible softness, no discernible shadow left by illusion. He was a man who looked upon life with a dispassionate, wry realism.<br><br>He knew he lived by care and by chance, knowing the next man he met might be the man who would kill him, or the next mile might see his horse down with a broken leg . . . and a man without a horse in this country was two-thirds a dead man.<br><br>To his thinking those men who thought their hour was predestined were fools. Whatever else nature was, it was impersonal, inexorable. He had seen too much of death to believe it was important, too much of life to believe that the destiny of any creature was important to any but itself or those dependent upon it.<br><br>There was always life. Humans and animals and plants were born and died, they lived their brief hour and went their way, their places filled so quickly they were scarcely missed.<br><br>Only the mountains lasted, and even they changed. Their lasting was only an idea in the minds of men because they lasted a little longer than men. Shalako knew he would live as long as he moved with care, considered the possibilities, and kept out of line of any stray bullet. Yet he was without illusions; for all his care, death could come and suddenly.<br><br>The margin for error was slight. A dry water hole, a chance fall, a stray bullet . . . or an Apache he missed seeing first.<br><br>Those who talked of a bullet with their name on it were fools . . . to a bullet all targets were anonymous.<br><br>Behind him to the east lay Mexico, but what trail he left back there only an Apache or a wolf might follow. Deliberately, he had avoided all known water holes, keeping to the roughest country, seeking out the rarely used seeps or tinajas, and avoiding the places an Apache might go in search of food.<br>He had seen nobody in those seven days, and nobody had seen him. He was quite sure of that for, had he been seen, he would be dead. Yet he knew that the Apaches had come down out of the Sierra Madre and were riding north.<br><br>He read the story in those weird hieroglyphics of the desert, the trails of unshod ponies, deserted rancherias, faint dust trails hanging above the desert, and always of course, the talking smoke.<br>Holding to the seeps and the natural tanks as he had, he had been fairly safe. Such places were rarely used except when the year was far along or it was a dry season. Early in the spring the desert water holes were full and there was no need to stray from them.<br><br>Removing his hat, he wiped the sweatband. No further sounds had reached him, nor was there any dust. Around him the desert lay still as on the day the earth was born. Yet he did not move.<br>Big Hatchet Peak towered more than eight thousand feet just to the south and west. He had crossed the border from Mexico into the States at a point in the foothills of the Sierra Rica, knowing the approximate location of the water hole toward which he was riding.<br><br>It lay about two miles up a canyon and two trails led from it. One started south and east, then swung westward toward Whitewater Wells, every inch of it Apache country.<br><br>The second trail was dim, scarcely used even by Indians, an ancient trail that dated back to the Mimbres people, long vanished from their old haunts, if not from the face of the earth.<br><br>This trail led almost due west from the water hole, was much shorter and less likely to be watched. The mind of the man called Shalako, as of most Western men, was a storehouse of such information. Where guidebooks and maps are not available, every campfire, chuck wagon, and saloon bar becomes a clearing-house for information.<br><br>It was hot, and the roan was streaked with sweat and dust. The border country can be cool in April. It can also be an oven, the way it was now.<br><br>He started his horse, walking it to keep the dust down. From the shade of a nearby boulder an irritable rattler buzzed unpleasantly, and then for a time a chaparral cock raced ahead of him, enjoying the company.<br><br>He paused again by a clump of ironwood, enjoying the fragrance from the yellow blossoms of some nearby cat's claw. Sometimes called "wait-a-minute," it was a low, spreading shrub with peculiar hooklike thorns that had crippled many a horse or other animal.<br><br>His eyes studied the desert. The tracks of a small lizard were visible in the sand . . . bees hummed around the cat's-claw blossoms. Shadows were beginning to thicken in some of the far-off canyons, although the sun was still high.<br><br>Shalako continued to walk his horse forward, and each time he mounted a slope, he came up easily at the crest until only his head showed above the hill, and there, holding very still to simulate a rock, he allowed only his eyes to move until he had scanned the area within view.<br><br>After almost an hour of slow progress, he rode down a draw toward a small playa, or dry lake. It was unlikely the killers had remained in the area but Shalako was not a trusting man.<br><br>Within the mouth of the draw he drew rein again. With his first glance he recognized the body for what it was, but only when he was quite sure that he was alone did he approach it. He circled it as warily as a wolf, studying it from all angles, and when finally he stopped within a dozen feet of the dead man he knew much of what had happened at this place.<br><br>The dead man had ridden a freshly shod horse into the playa from the north, and when shot he had tumbled from the saddle and the horse had galloped away. Several riders on unshod ponies had then approached the body and one had dismounted to collect the weapons.<br><br>The clothing had not been stripped off, nor was the body mutilated. Only when he could learn no more by observation did he dismount and turn the body over. He was already sure of the dead man's identity.<br><br>Pete Wells . . . <br><br>An occasional scout for the Army, a sometime driver of freight wagons, a former buffalo hunter and lately a hanger-on around Fort Bowie, Fort Grant, or Tucson. A man of no particular quality, honest enough, and not a man likely to make enemies. Yet now he was dead, shot from ambush.<br><br>Circling, Shalako discovered where the ambushers had lain in wait.<br><br>Four men . . . four Apaches.<br><br>He studied the droppings of the horses, kicking them apart with a boot toe. He recognized in those droppings seeds from a plant found in the foothills of the Sierra Madre, but not farther north.<br><br>These were not reservation Indians from San Carlos then, they were some of Chato's outfit, just up from below the border.<br><br>Their trail when they left Wells's body lay in the direction he himself was taking, and that meant the water hole was off-limits for Shalako unless he wished to fight them for it, and no man in his right mind started a fight with Apaches.<br><br>When the time came for fighting, the man Shalako fought with a cold fury that had an utterly impersonal quality about it. He fought to win, fought with deadly efficiency, with no nonsense about him, yet he did not fight needlessly.<br><br>Despite his weariness and that of his horse he began backtracking the dead man.<br><br>Pete Wells was not likely to be alone, so his presence indicated a camp nearby, and a camp meant water. Yet Shalako puzzled over his presence here at such a time.<br><br>The Hatchet Mountains were in a corner of New Mexico that projected somewhat south of the rest of the state line. It was a desert and mountain region, off the main trails and offering no inducements to travel except several routes into Mexico. These were routes used by the Apaches in making their raids, but by no one else.<br><br>Unless Wells had been with the Army.<br><br>Within a few minutes Shalako knew that was highly unlikely, for Wells had been following another rider or looking for someone whom he did not fear. Wells had mounted every ridge and knoll to survey the surrounding country, and Wells knew better than to take such risks.<br><br>Obviously, he knew nothing of the movement of the Apaches, and that implied that nobody else knew as yet. Wells was close to the Army and would be among the first to hear.<br><br>Shalako had backtrailed Wells for less than two miles when he came upon the trail Wells had lost.</p><h2>Loving and Leaving the Good Life</h2><p>The sequel to The Limits of Growth illustrates the state of the world&#39;s population, non-renewable resource use, industrial output, food production, and pollution, arguing that humans are using resources and producing waste at unsustainable rates.</p><p>Helen and Scott Nearing wrote Living the Good Life and many other best-selling books about working hard, living simply and self-sufficiently while saving time for fun and pursuits of the intellect. This is a book written by Helen after Scott died (at 100 years old!), and is a story of love and living and dying on one&#39;s own terms, at peace with the world and with one&#39;s own heart.

The diversity of meanings and practices signified by painting today can encompass the eclecticism associated with net-surfing and the philosophical naming as &#39;painting&#39; of artworks that manifest no trace of paint. This is the first anthology to bring together key statements, dialogues and debates by artists and writers on art that have been building blocks of the latest era in painting&#39;s history. Predominantly first published in magazines, journals and catalogues, these texts recontextualize polarized debates and reignite questions for the future. Tracing the story from the &#39;neo&#39; revivals onward, this collection also ranges widely across ideas and practices of the preceding decades as they have been re-evaluated by artists and theorists in the frame of contemporary ideas.Artists surveyed include Glenn Brown, Vija Celmins, John Currin, Marlene Dumas, Olafur Eliasson, Bernard Frize, Katharina Grosse, Andreas Gursky, Peter Halley, Gary Hume, Jutta Koether, Paul McCarthy, Suzanne McCleland, Beatriz Milhazes, Takashi Murakami, Albert Oehlen, Lari Pittman, Sigmar Polke, Gerhard Richter, Robert Ryman, David Salle, Cheri Samba, Jim Shaw, Jessica Stockholder, Philip Taaffe, Luc Tuymans, Jeff Wall and Sue Williams. Writers include Daniel Birnbaum, Norman Bryson, Douglas Crimp, Gilles Deleuze, Sebastian Egenhofer, Hal Foster, Jeremy Gilbert-Rolfe, Isabelle Graw, David Joselit, Shirley Kaneda, Geeta Kapur, Thomas Lawson, Midori Matsui, Lane Relyea, Rene Ricard, Jerry Saltz, Mira Schor, Barry Schwabsky and Adrian Searle.</p><p>Terry R. Myers is a Chicago and Los Angeles-based writer, educator and independent curator. A regular contributor since 1988 to numerous international journals, including The Brooklyn Rail, Art Review, Parkett, and Modern Painters, he is the author of Mary Heilmann: Save the Last Dance for Me (Afterall Books, 2007). He is Associate Professor of Painting &amp; Drawing at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago.&#34;This superb collection of newly classical writings proceeds from the virtual end of painting in 1981 to its many re-emergences, all the more vital each time. Whether an individual text questions, explains or marvels at what painting can do, each merits attention, even a painter&#39;s attention.&#34; - Richard Shiff, Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art of Europe and America, University of Texas at Austin &#34;The great number of young artists who set out each year to become painters should long ago have put to rest conversations about the so-called death of painting. But this debate has been far too evocative for the art would simply to let it go, as Terry R. Myers points out in his introduction to this superb collection of iconic essays by artists and writers. His curated volume is full of revelations, demonstrating that it is the tension between the desire for painting and the theoretical arguments it provokes that continues to keep us intellectually and visually enthralled. This terrific anthology lays it all out.&#34; - Carol Becker, Dean of Columbia University School of the Arts, author of Thinking in Place: Art, Action and Cultural Production.</p><h2>Squeezed: Why Our Families Can&#39;t Afford America</h2><p><p><strong>One of TIME&#x2019;s Best New Books to Read This Summer</strong></p><p><strong>&#x201c;Brilliant&#x2014;a keen, elegantly written, and scorching account of the American family today.

Their dual fates become forever linked by an anonymous letter to a local paper critical of the school--a letter whose mysterious authorship will weigh heavily on their lives.<br><br>Driven by socialist dreams and political desire, Smallwood will walk a railroad line the breadth of Newfoundland in a journey of astonishing power and beauty, to unionize the workers--and make his name. Fielding, now a popular newspaper columnist, provides--in her journalism, her diaries, and her bleakly hilarious "Condensed History of Newfoundland"--a satirical and eloquent counternarrative to Smallwood's story.<br><br>As the decades pass and Smallwood's rise converges with Newfoundland's emerging autonomy, these two vexed characters must confront their own frailties and secrets--and their mutual (if doomed) love.<br><br><b>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams</b> combines erudition, unflagging narrative brio, and emotional depth in a manner reminiscent of the best of Robertson Davies and John Irving. Set in a landscape already made familiar to American readers by Annie Proulx and Howard Norman, it establishes Wayne Johnston as a novelist who is as profound as he is funny, with an unerringly ironic sense of the intersection where private lives and history collide.</p><p>In 1949, Joseph Smallwood became the first premier of the newly federated Canadian province of Newfoundland. Predictably, and almost immediately, his name retreated to the footnotes of history. And yet, as Wayne Johnston makes plain in his epic and affectionate fifth novel, <i>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams</i>, Smallwood's life was endearingly emblematic, an instance of an extraordinary man emerging at a propitious moment. The particular charm of Johnston's book, however, lies not merely in unveiling a career that so seamlessly coincided with the burgeoning self-consciousness of Newfoundland itself, but in exposing a simple truth--namely, that history is no more than the accretion of lived lives.<p> Born into debilitating poverty, Smallwood is sustained by a bottomless faith in his own industry. His unabashed ambition is to "rise not from rags to riches, but from obscurity to world renown." To this end, he undertakes tasks both sublime and baffling--walking 700 miles along a Newfoundland railroad line in a self-martyring union drive; narrating a homespun radio spot; and endlessly irritating and ingratiating himself with the Newfoundland political machine. His opaque and constant incitement is an unconsummated love for his childhood friend, Sheilagh Fielding. Headstrong and dissolute, she weaves in and out of Smallwood's life like a salaried goad, alternately frustrating and illuminating his ambitions. Smallwood is harried as well by Newfoundland's subtle gravity, a sense that he can never escape the tug of his native land, since his only certainty is the island itself--that "massive assertion of land, sea's end, the outer limit of all the water in the world, a great, looming, sky-obliterating chunk of rock."</p><p> <i>The Colony of Unrequited Dreams</i> bogs down after a time in its detailing of Smallwood's many political intrigues and in the lingering matter of a mysterious letter supposedly written by Fielding. However, when he speculates on the secret motives of his peers, or when he reveals his own hyperbolic fantasies and grandiose hopes--matters no one would ever confess aloud--the novel is both apt and amiable. Best of all is to watch Smallwood's inevitable progress toward a practical cynicism. It seems nothing less than miraculous that his countless disappointments pave the way for his ascension, that his private travails ultimately align with the land he loves. This is history resuscitated. <i>--Ben Guterson</i></p>Wayne Johnston s fictional autobiography of Joey Smallwood, the cunning politician who all but dragged Newfoundland into Canada, is a combination of mystery and love story. Energetically narrated by Newfoundland actor Boyd Norman, this audio edition tells the epic story of Smallwood s rise from poverty and obscurity to the office of Newfoundland s first premier. At the heart of Johnston s masterful novel, however, is Smallwood s life-long relationship with Sheilagh Fielding, an acerbic, hard-drinking journalist whom he first meets when he is a struggling scholarship student at a St. John s boarding school. The two are bound together by a childhood secret and an unfulfilled passion for one another.</p><h2>Borders The Basics &amp; Beyond: A Complete Guide to Border Techniques with Dozens of Designs to Mix and Match (Landauer)</h2><p><p>See how blocks with basic design elements, good color and contrast, and correct application add drama and style to any quilt! <em>Borders: The Basics and Beyond</em> is the complete guide to good border design techniques, making it perfect for any quilter to practice and build their skills.</p> <p>With step-by-step instructions, full-color photography, and helpful diagrams, learn over 20 border techniques, from the basket weave and scrappy sawtooth to pinwheels and flying geese.

The process encouraged fresh and often murderous oppositions between those who were for, and those who were against, the Revolution&#x2019;s values. Bearing the scars of their country&#x2019;s bloody struggle, and its legacy of deeply divided loyalties, the French lived the long nineteenth century in the shadow of the revolutionary age. </p><p> Despite the ghosts raised in this epic tale, Robert Gildea has written a richly engaging and provocative book. His is a strikingly unfamiliar France, a country with an often overwhelming gap between Paris and the provinces, a country torn apart by fratricidal hatreds and a tortured history of feminism, the site of political catastrophes and artistic triumphs, and a country that managed&#x2014;despite a pervasive awareness of its own fall from grace&#x2014;to fix itself squarely at the heart of modernity. Indeed, Gildea reveals how the collective recognition of the great costs of the Revolution galvanized the French to achieve consensus in a new republic and to integrate the tumultuous past into their sense of national identity. It was in this spirit that France&#x2019;s young men went to the front in World War I with a powerful sense of national confidence and purpose. </p></p><p><b>Robert Gildea</b> is Professor of Modern History at the University of Oxford, and the author of <i>Marianne in Chains</i>, the winner of the Wolfson Prize for history.The French Revolution's cries of "liberty, fraternity, and equality" reverberated throughout Europe and America. Yet in France, as Oxford historian Gildea demonstrates in this elegant political and cultural history, the consequences of the revolution were far more ambiguous: its mixed legacy included "hope for a new day" as well as "anarchy, bloodletting and despotism."... Invoking writers and thinkers from Musset to Flaubert to P�guy, Gildea's spellbinding book offers a challenging new portrait of the long-term impact of the French Revolution. (<i>Publishers Weekly (starred)</i> 2008-07-14)<br><br>[A] thoroughly researched work of scholarship. (Jim Doyle <i>Library Journal</i> 2008-09-15)<br><br>At the heart of Robert Gildea's <i>Children of the Revolution: The French, 1799&#x2013;1914</i> is a vast project: not just a history of France during those astonishing years--from Napoleon to the killing fields of Verdun--but a history of the French themselves. There's a sea of books on the French Revolution and its fallout. There's another sea of books on French cultural history--its edgy Parisian salons, its sun-drenched villages in Provence. It's rare to try to fuse both, rarer still to do it well. He does...It's a great read. (Gail Russell Chaddock <i>Christian Science Monitor</i> 2008-10-16)<br><br>[An] erudite account of France's long nineteenth century...It is impossible to interpret the slaughter of a million and a half people as a triumph in any setting, but Gildea shows unforgettably a national identity winning out against all odds. It's a lengthy, complex saga, but he manages to sustain enough buoyancy in his prose to allow it to be read from beginning to end with interest and pleasure...One of the considerable strengths of <i>Children of the Revolution</i> is Gildea's eye for an individual example, anecdote or aphorism, combined with his comprehensive knowledge of the literature of nineteenth-century France...Gildea's book is a substantial contribution to understanding the individual nation that is France. (Ruth Scurr <i>The Nation</i> 2008-11-24)<br><br>Stimulating and highly readable...Robert Gildea has drawn very effectively on recent research in the areas he chooses to explore, and he presents his material in admirably lucid and entertaining prose. And, above all, he succeeds in one central task: showing just how surprisingly livable and creative France was during this golden century-long interval between two moments of horror. No wonder that so many remain nostalgic for it, and not just within the country's borders. (David A. Bell <i>New Republic</i> 2009-04-01)<br><br>With penetration and style, [Gildea] paints a complex portrait of a society geographically and temperamentally divided, constantly at war with itself, yet managing to forge a cohesive national identity at home and abroad.

As she navigates this new reality, Astrid finds strength in her unshakable certainty of her own worth and her unfettered sense of the absurd.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, May 1999:</b> Astrid Magnussen, the teenage narrator of Janet Fitch's engrossing first novel, <i>White Oleander</i>, has a mother who is as sharp as a new knife. An uncompromising poet, Ingrid despises weakness and self-pity, telling her daughter that they are descendants of Vikings, savages who fought fiercely to survive. And when one of Ingrid's boyfriends abandons her, she illustrates her point, killing the man with the poison of oleander flowers. This leads to a life sentence in prison, leaving Astrid to teach herself the art of survival in a string of Los Angeles foster homes. <p> As Astrid bumps from trailer park to tract house to Hollywood bungalow, <i>White Oleander</i> uncoils her existential anxieties. "Who was I, really?" she asks. "I was the sole occupant of my mother's totalitarian state, my own personal history rewritten to fit the story she was telling that day. There were so many missing pieces." Fitch adroitly leads Astrid down a path of sorting out her past and identity. In the process, this girl develops a wire-tight inner strength, gains her mother's white-blonde beauty, and achieves some measure of control over their relationship. Even from prison, Ingrid tries to mold her daughter. Foiling her, Astrid learns about tenderness from one foster mother and how to stand up for herself from another. Like the weather in Los Angeles--the winds of the Santa Anas, the scorching heat--Astrid's teenage life is intense. Fitch's novel deftly displays that, and also makes Astrid's life meaningful. <i>--Katherine Anderson</i></p>Oprah Winfrey&#39;s legacy has established her as one of the most important figures in popular culture.

When he was born, in 1809, scarcely 3,000 Jews lived in the entire country. By the time of his assassination in 1865, large-scale immigration, principally from central Europe, had brought that number up to more than 150,000. Many Americans, including members of Lincoln's cabinet and many of his top generals during the Civil War, were alarmed by this development and treated Jews as second-class citizens and religious outsiders. Lincoln, this book shows, exhibited precisely the opposite tendency. He also expressed a uniquely deep knowledge of the Old Testament, employing its language and concepts in some of his most important writings. He befriended Jews from a young age, promoted Jewish equality, appointed numerous Jews to public office, had Jewish advisors and supporters starting already from the early 1850s, as well as later during his two presidential campaigns, and in response to Jewish sensitivities, even changed the way he thought and spoke about America. Through his actions and his rhetoric&#x2015;replacing "Christian nation," for example, with "this nation under God"&#x2015;he embraced Jews as insiders. </p><p>In this groundbreaking work, the product of meticulous research, historian Jonathan D. Sarna and collector Benjamin Shapell reveal how Lincoln's remarkable relationship with American Jews impacted both his path to the presidency and his policy decisions as president. The volume uncovers a new and previously unknown feature of Abraham Lincoln's life, one that broadened him, and, as a result, broadened America.</p></p><p><p>JONATHAN D. SARNA is a Professor of American Jewish History at Brandeis University and president of the Association for Jewish Studies. Sarna has written hundreds of scholarly articles and the acclaimed <i>American Judaism: A History</i>, winner of the Jewish Book Council's Jewish Book of the Year Award.</p><p>BENJAMIN SHAPELL founded the Shapell Manuscript Foundation, an independent educational organization whose collection includes original documents of renowned individuals, including Lincoln, other American presidents, and Mark Twain.</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing brings history to life more vividly than handwritten letters, maps, and photographs.

If a picture is worth a thousand words, then this book is further elevated, and exponentially, by the prominence of hundreds of magnificent illustrations--many from the amazing Shapell archive, and quite a few of them new to this old hand at Lincoln relics and portraiture. The result is that happiest marriage of text and images: an instant classic.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>HAROLD HOLZER, ROGER HERTOG FELLOW, NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY</i></p><p>&#x201c;This book is one of the most fascinating troves of American history and Jewish history I have ever seen.

This new study broadens our understanding of the American Jewish experience during the Civil War.

Sarna, a preeminent historian of American Jewry, and Shapell, the founder of the Shapell Manuscript Foundation, make good use of what Shapell calls "the &#x2018;other' letters of U.S. presidents"--ones that don't present significant historical facts, but that limn the quotidian aspects of Lincoln's life, such as his recommendation of his Jewish chiropodist, Issachar Zacharie. The authors convincingly make the case that Lincoln's positive attitude toward Jews was strongly influenced by Abraham Jonas--a fellow Illinois politician, the only man Lincoln ever directly called "one of my most valued friends," and one of the first to suggest that he seek the Republican nomination for President in 1860. Jonas also warned his friend of a plot to assassinate him before his first inauguration. Images of the source material add depth and lend perspective; a page from a narrative describing Lincoln's death is stained with blood, probably the president's.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY (STARRED)</i></p><p>&#x201c;A noted historian asks new questions about Abraham Lincoln...

I wish I could say that we&#x2019;ll start at the beginning. But I don&#x2019;t know where it starts. Just like everyone else, I&#x2019;m not truly aware of the real sequence of cause and effect in my life.<br><br>Does the story start when I realised that I was only the fourth-best soccer player in the class? When Basse, my grandfather, showed me the drawings&#x2014;his own drawings&#x2014;of La Sagrada Fam�lia? When I took my first drag on a cigarette and heard my first track by the Grateful Dead? When I read Kant at university and thought I understood it? When I sold my first lump of hash? Or did it start when I kissed Bobby&#x2014;who&#x2019;s actually a girl&#x2014;or the first time I saw the tiny, wrinkled creature who would end up being called Anna screaming up at me? Perhaps it was when I was sitting in the Fisherman&#x2019;s stinking back room and he was telling me what he wanted me to do. I don&#x2019;t know. We store up all sorts of stories with fabricated logic, so that life can look as though it has some meaning.<br><br>So I may as well start here, in the midst of the confusion, at a time and a place where fate seemed to be taking a short break, holding its breath. When, just for a moment, I thought I was not only on my way, but had also already arrived.<br><br>I got off the bus in the middle of the night. Screwed my eyes up against the sun. It was scouring across an island out to sea, off to the north. Red and dull. Like me. Beyond it lay yet more sea. And, beyond that, the North Pole. Perhaps this was somewhere they wouldn&#x2019;t find me.<br><br>I looked round. In the three other points of the compass low mountain ridges sloped down towards me. Red and green heather, rocks, a few clumps of stunted birch trees. To the east the land slid into the sea, stony and flat as a pancake, and to the southwest it was as if it had been cut with a knife at the point where the sea started. A hundred metres or so above the motionless sea a plateau of open landscape took over, stretching inland. The Finnmark plateau. The end of the line, as Grand�father used to say.<br><br>The hard-packed gravel road I stood on led to a cluster of low buildings. The only thing that stuck out was the church tower. I&#x2019;d woken up in my seat on the bus just as we were passing a sign with the name &#x201c;K�sund&#x201d; on it, down by the shore, near a wooden jetty. And I thought, why not? and pulled the cord above the window to illuminate the stop sign above the bus driver.<br><br>I put on the jacket of my suit, grabbed my leather case and started walking. The pistol in the jacket pocket bounced against my hip. Right on the bone&#x2014;I&#x2019;d always been too thin. I stopped and tugged my money belt down under my shirt so that the notes would cushion the knocks.<br><br>There wasn&#x2019;t a cloud in the sky, and the air was so clear that I felt I could see a very long way. As far as the eye can see, as the expression goes. They say that the Finnmark plateau is beautiful. Fucked if I know. Isn&#x2019;t that just the sort of thing people say about inhospitable places? Either to make themselves seem a bit tough, to lay claim to some sort of insight or superiority, the way people boast about liking incomprehensible music or unreadable literature? I&#x2019;d done it myself. I used to think it might make up for at least a few of the things about me that weren&#x2019;t good enough. Or else it was simply meant as a consolation to the few people who had to live there: &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so beautiful here.&#x201d; Because what was so beautiful about this flat, monotonous, bleak landscape? It&#x2019;s like Mars. A red desert. Uninhabitable and cruel. The perfect hiding place. Hopefully.<br><br>The branches of a clump of trees by the side of the road in front of me moved. A moment later a figure leaped across the ditch and onto the road. My hand went automatically for the pistol but I stopped it: it wasn&#x2019;t one of them. This character looked like a joker who&#x2019;d jumped straight out of a pack of cards.<br><br>&#x201c;Good evening!&#x201d; he called to me.<br><br>He walked towards me with a strange, rolling gait, so bandy-legged that I could see the road stretch out towards the village between his legs. As he came closer I saw he wasn&#x2019;t wearing a court jester&#x2019;s hat on his head but a S�mi cap. Blue, red and yellow&#x2014;only the bells were missing. He was wearing pale leather boots, and his blue anorak, patched with black tape, had several tears revealing yellow-coloured padding that looked more like loft insulation than feathers.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me asking,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But who are you?&#x201d;<br><br>He was at least two heads shorter than I. His face was broad, his grin wide, and his eyes at something of a slant. If you piled up all the clich�s people in Oslo have about what a S�mi or native Laplander looked like, you&#x2019;d end up with this bloke.<br><br>&#x201c;I came on the bus,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;So I saw. I&#x2019;m Mattis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mattis,&#x201d; I repeated, to gain a few seconds to think about the answer to his next inevitable question.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ulf,&#x201d; I said. It seemed as good a name as any.<br><br>&#x201c;And what are you doing in K�sund?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m just visiting,&#x201d; I said, nodding towards the cluster of houses.<br><br>&#x201c;Who are you visiting?&#x201d;<br><br>I shrugged. &#x201c;No one special.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Are you from the Countryside Commission, or are you a preacher?&#x201d;<br><br>I didn&#x2019;t know what people from the Countryside Commission looked like, so I shook my head and ran a hand through my long, hippy hair. Maybe I should cut it. Less eye-catching.<br><br>&#x201c;Forgive me asking,&#x201d; he said again, &#x201c;but what are you, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A hunter,&#x201d; I said. It might have been the mention of the Countryside Commission. And it was as much the truth as it was a lie.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh? Are you going to hunt here, Ulf?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like good hunting territory.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but you&#x2019;re a week early. Hunting season doesn&#x2019;t start until the fifteenth of August.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there a hotel here?&#x201d;<br><br>The S�mi smiled broadly. He coughed and spat out a brown lump that I hoped was chewing tobacco or something similar. It hit the ground with an audible splat.<br><br>&#x201c;Lodging house?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>He shook his head.<br><br>&#x201c;Camping cabin? Room to rent?&#x201d; On the telephone pole behind him someone had stuck up a poster about a dance band who were going to be playing in Alta. So the city couldn&#x2019;t be too far away. Maybe I should have stayed on the bus until it got there.<br><br>&#x201c;How about you, Mattis?&#x201d; I said, slapping away a gnat that was biting my forehead. &#x201c;You wouldn&#x2019;t happen to have a bed I could borrow tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I burned my bed in the stove back in May. We had a cold May.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sofa? Mattress?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mattress?&#x201d; He spread his hands out towards the heather-covered plateau.<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, but I like roofs and walls. I&#x2019;ll have to try and find an empty dog kennel. Goodnight.&#x201d; I set off towards the houses.<br><br>&#x201c;The only kennel you&#x2019;ll find in K�sund is that one,&#x201d; he called out plaintively, his voice falling.<br><br>I turned round. He was pointing at the building in front of the cluster of houses.<br><br>&#x201c;The church?&#x201d;<br><br>He nodded.<br><br>&#x201c;Is it open in the middle of the night?&#x201d;<br><br>Mattis tilted his head. &#x201c;Do you know why no one steals anything in K�sund? Because there&#x2019;s nothing worth stealing apart from reindeer.&#x201d;</p><h2>Desert Notes: Reflections in the Eye of a Raven</h2><p>A free-lance writer and photographer invites the reader to walk with him through the desert where life is clear and elemental</p><p></p><h2>An American Primer</h2><p>The 83 most important documents of the American past are presented with commentary by Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., Henry Steele Commager, and other distinguished historians.

For countless people, the drug offered a reprieve from what had been a death sentence; for others, it was too late. In the United States alone, over 318,000 people had already died from AIDS-related complications among them the singer Michael Callen and the poet Essex Hemphill.<br> <br>Meticulously researched and evocatively told, <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> is the celebrated historian Martin Duberman&#x2019;s poignant memorial to those lost to AIDS and to two of the great unsung heroes of the early years of the epidemic.<br>Callen, a white gay Midwesterner who had moved to New York, became a leading figure in the movement to increase awareness of AIDS in the face of willful and homophobic denial under the Reagan administration; Hemphill, an African American gay man, contributed to the black gay and lesbian scene in Washington, D.C., with poetry of searing intensity and introspection.<br> <br>A profound exploration of the intersection of race, sexuality, class, identity, and the politics of AIDS activism beyond ACT UP, <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> captures both a generation struggling to cope with the deadly disease and the extraordinary refusal of two men to give in to despair.</p><p><b>Martin Duberman</b> is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of History at the CUNY Graduate School. The author of more than twenty books, including a highly acclaimed biography of Paul Robeson, Duberman has won a Bancroft Prize and been a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. He lives in New York City.<br><b>Praise for <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> </b>:<br> <br>"A meticulously researched, nuanced, empathic and insightful portrait of two important artistic and political figures who came to prominence in the early years of the AIDS epidemic."<br> <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> <br> <br>"In this insightful history, gay rights activist and distinguished historian Duberman (<i>Stonewall</i>) attempts to revive AIDS awareness by detailing the early years of the epidemic, particularly the period of 1981 1995. He sets the details within a framework constructed around the experiences of two men: white singer/activist Michael Callen and black poet/cultural worker Essex Hemphill, both of whom lived with AIDS for years and died at age 38. Duberman pulls no punches in capturing the chaos, uncertainty, and ignorance of the era, looking at the sexual culture that allowed the disease to thrive; he also examines the fear and contradictions of the political environment. Through interviews, writings, personal experience, and Hemphill's poetry, Duberman creates a vivid, complex snapshot of the fractured, conflicted gay community as it responded to the growing problem. It&#x2019;s a sobering narrative, replete with the sexism, racism, homophobia, and false leads that marked the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Most importantly, it addresses the role of AIDS as a 'gay disease' and exposes the differences between the white and black gay communities in their responses. Duberman&#x2019;s accessible, open, and honest prose reminds us that AIDS is not over; only the sense of urgency has waned."<br> <i>Publishers Weekly</i> (starred review)<br> <br>"Seldom has a biographer been able to honor the doomed courage of his subjects with such redeeming insightfulness. Martin Duberman's <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> is an unflinching masterpiece."<br> David Levering Lewis, university professor emeritus, New York University, and recipient of the Pulitzer Prize for Biography<br> <br>"We are always in danger of forgetting the past, and the huge advances we have made against HIV/AIDS often obscure the pain and the politics of the early years of the epidemic. In <i>Hold Tight Gently</i>, Martin Duberman has brilliantly recreated this tumultuous era. Tracing these two lives through poetry and activism, Duberman captures the pain, despair, panic, heroism, and moral bravery that defined the generation of women and men who first faced this modern plague. Daringly imagined and beautifully written, <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> is a major work of modern history that chills us to the bone even as it moves us to tears."<br> Michael Bronski, Professor of the Practice in Activism and Media Studies of Women, Gender and Sexuality, Harvard University<br> <br>"A dynamic people's history of AIDS that must be read, debated, critiqued and applauded. Michael Callen, Essex Hemphill, and other visionaries are revealed as complex individuals who made change but did not benefit from it. Throughout, Duberman confronts the racism at the core of the AIDS movement that became the global crisis of access to treatment. A bold work for a community that wants to understand itself."<br> Sarah Schulman, author <i>Israel/Palestine and The Queer International</i> <br> <br>"Martin Duberman&#x2019;s work has been a continuing rescue mission to make sure that vital, but forgotten, stories from the past remain alive in our memory. With <i>Hold Tight Gently</i>, he has done it again and magnificently so. Michael Callen and Essex Hemphill come back to life in these pages. Funny and moving, enlightening and thoughtful, inspiring and enraging, this dual biography reveals the heartbreaking losses caused by the epidemic as well as the many ways people fought back. It can teach those who weren't there what that first decade of AIDS was like and remind those of us who were how intense those years were. And all this through the life stories of two compelling individuals."<br> John D&#x2019;Emilio, Professor of Gender and Women's Studies &amp; History at the University of Illinois at Chicago<br> <br>"<i>Hold Tight Gently</i> is a deeply moving work of largely hidden history. Martin Duberman not only brilliantly chronicles grassroots AIDS organizing in the early days of the epidemic, but the vibrant black lesbian and gay political and cultural movement that flowered during the same period. Through the lives of two remarkable men, <i>Hold Tight Gently</i> illuminates how race and class are inextricably linked to the struggle for sexual freedom and that against all odds people can fight for justice every day. A wonderful and important book."<br> Barbara Smith, author of <i>The Truth That Never Hurts</i> and co-founder of Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press<br> <br>"Through his probing and insightful chronicle of the lives two very different gay men who were early voices in the fight against AIDS, Martin Duberman has again brought light to shine in a personal way on the role of progressives in LGBT struggles and the importance of addressing how race, class, and gender impact this epidemic and who survives it. Sadly, these perspectives are still urgently needed in today's world where those facing the devastation of AIDS are often invisible to mainstream politics. A poignant and politically potent tribute to those who have died from AIDS and who fought to make a difference even as their lives were cut short."<br> Charlotte Bunch, Distinguished Professor in Women's and Gender Studies, Rutgers University<br> <br>"<i>Hold Tight Gently</i> is an absorbing read. It&#x2019;s a necessary introduction to the uninitiated, and a profound challenge to the collective amnesia concerning the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, one that shimmers with insights and lessons about race, sexuality, and class. Duberman's take on these seminal figures illuminates their singular and collective triumphs and struggles, and critically how the pandemic profoundly impacted political and social organizing by gays in the eighties and nineties. The biographer renders Hemphill and Callen with respect and grace just the way they should be."<br> Steven G. Fullwood, co-editor of <i>Black Gay Genius</i> <br> <br>"Marty Duberman's profoundly moving reconsideration of Michael Callen and Essex Hemphill is much needed now, as AIDS continues to ravage so much of our world.

A lonely child growing up in the woods of northern Michigan in the 1950s, he gives little thought to his own talent. But with his acceptance at U.C.

The patriarch, Milo Andret, is a drinker with a nasty demeanor that gets him booted out of both Princeton and the arms of his one true love (who marries his rival); a generation later, his son Hans, a hedge-fund billionaire by the age of 20 (his field was &#x201c;applied&#x201d; mathematics which to his purist father &#x201c;might as well have been Himalayan transcentalist studies&#x201d;) seems headed down the same path. But Hans tries to understand history as well as math, and manages, sort of, to come to terms with his father, his legacy and himself. This novel is the kind of epic story we&#x2019;ve read before--it&#x2019;s almost Biblical--and yet Canin makes it all seem new. Maybe it&#x2019;s the discussions about math, which are less off-putting than I at first feared they would be, and maybe it&#x2019;s the way he makes these superbly flawed characters seem...well, if not likable, then at least recognizable. (Personally, I credit the female characters, the ex-girlfriend, the mother, the sister--helpmeets, all--who are nonetheless both the backbone and the heart of the book.) Canin will surely catch some flak for some overlong passages and some scenes of very obvious Freudianness, but they&#x2019;re buffeted by beautiful writing and a story line that, for all its tragic familiarity, never gets old. <em>--Sara Nelson</em><b>Ethan Canin </b>is the author of seven books, including the story collections <i>Emperor of the Air </i>and <i>The Palace Thief</i> and the novels <i>For Kings and Planets,</i> <i>Carry Me Across the Water, </i>and<i> America America. </i>He is on the faculty of the Iowa Writers&#x2019; Workshop and divides his time between Iowa and northern Michigan.</p><h2>The &#39;West Wing&#39; Scriptbook</h2><p>The West Wing has been named &#39;TV Show of the Year&#39; by Entertainment Weekly, and stars Stockard Channing, Dule Hill, Allison Janney, Rob Lowe, Janel Moloney, Richard Schiff, Martin Sheen, John Spencer, and Bradly Whitford.

Bentley, the Snowflake Man</h2><p>Boyds Mills Press publishes a wide range of high-quality fiction and nonfiction picture books, chapter books, novels, and nonfiction</p><p>Grade 1-5-Following in the footsteps of Jacqueline Briggs Martin's Snowflake Bentley (Houghton, 1998), this picture-book biography covers the life of Bentley at a similar reading level, but with a slightly different approach. Bahr's text, told from the point of view of Bentley's older brother, goes for the emotional heart of the story rather than a straight telling of the facts about the man's life and work. As seen through Charlie's eyes, Wilson's pioneering work in photographing snowflakes becomes secondary to the human qualities that led him to persist in what many called a pointless task: "That's the way I'll remember my brother. Always seeing the beauty. Always sharing it. Always taking care not to hurt anything." Jacobsen's illustrations have softer colors and less chunky lines than Mary Azarian's woodcuts for Martin's book. Multiple boxed scenes on each spread move the story along, and snowflakes spill joyfully through the borders. An author's note gives additional information about Wilson Bentley, but does not mention his brother at all, and it is not clear where the information included in this "imaginary reminiscence" was gathered. Still, the choice to use Charlie's voice creates an affectionate and moving portrait of a dedicated man, and, for all its similarities to Martin's book, this biography has a unique charm of its own.<br><i>Kathleen Kelly MacMillan, Maryland School for the Deaf, Columbia</i><br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Republic and Empire (Imperial Stars, Vol 2)</h2><p>Stories and articles with space colonies, dictators, ambassadors, utopias, colleges of the future, cults, alien invaders, and interstellar politics</p><p></p><h2>ARCHITECTURE OF COCKTAIL PB</h2><p>The perfect home begins with a blueprint and a dream and your perfect cocktail should start the same way.

Thad&#x2019;s even gone so far as to stage a mock burial of his wildly successful pseudonym, complete with tombstone and the epitaph &#x201c;Not a Very Nice Guy.&#x201d; Although on the surface, it seems that Thad can finally concentrate on his own novels, there&#x2019;s a certain unease at the prospect of leaving George Stark behind. But that&#x2019;s nothing compared to the horror about to descend upon Thad&#x2019;s new life. There are the vicious, out-of-control nightmares, for starters. And how is he able to explain the fact that everyone connected to George Stark&#x2019;s untimely demise is now meeting a brutal end of their own in a pattern of homicidal savagery...and why each blood-soaked crime scene has Thad&#x2019;s fingerprints all over it? Thad Beaumont may have once believed that George Stark was running out of things to say, but he&#x2019;s going to find out just how wrong he is...</p><p>In 1985, 39-year-old Stephen King announced in public that his pseudonymous alter ego, Richard Bachman, was dead. (Never mind that he revived him years later to write <i>The Regulators</i>.) At the beginning of <i>The Dark Half</i> (1989), 39-year-old writer Thad Beaumont announces in public that his own pseudonym, George Stark, is dead. <p> Now, King didn't want to jettison the Bachman novel, titled <i>Machine Dreams</i>, that was he working on. So he incorporated it in <i>The Dark Half</i> as the crime oeuvre of George Stark, whose recurring hero/alter ego is an evil character named Alexis Machine.</p><p> Thad Beaumont's pseudonym is not so docile as Stephen King's, though, and George Stark bursts forth into reality. At that point, two stories kick into gear: a mystery-detective story about the crime spree of George Stark (or is it Alexis Machine?) and a horror story about Beaumont's struggle to catch up with his doppelganger and kill him dead.</p><p> This is not the first time that Stephen King has written a dark allegory about the fiction writer's situation. As the <i>New York Times</i> writes, "<i>Misery</i> (1987) is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his audience, which holds him prisoner and dictates what he writes, on pain of death. <i>The Dark Half</i> is a parable in chiller form of the popular writer's relation to his creative genius, the vampire within him, the part of him that only awakes to raise Cain when he writes, the fratricidal twin who occupies 'the womblike dungeon' of his imagination." <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Lopez Jr. offers an expert but lucid account that demystifies Buddhism and explains its practices, teachings, and schools. Blending penetrating analysis with engaging storytelling, Lopez makes Buddhism accessible and compelling as he reveals the commonalities and differences among the major traditions. <em>The Story of Buddhism</em> focuses on actual lived practice and shows why Buddhism has been so appealing and helpful through many centuries and many cultures, including our own.</p><p>Lopez begins with the creation and structure of the Buddhist universe and then tells the story of the life of the Buddha, weaving a tapestry of history, legend, and doctrine (a traditional approach in Buddhist literature). He explores important concepts such as dharma -- including devotional practices and techniques of meditation -- and sangha -- the communities of monks, nuns, and laypeople who follow the teachings of the Buddha. Finally, the author probes the meaning of enlightenment as a path to the realization of one's true nature and freedom from suffering.</p><p>Complete with a glossary, detailed index, and comprehensive bibliography, <em>The Story of Buddhism</em> is a rich presentation of the Buddhist tradition. Whether you are a practicing Buddhist, a student of world religions, or both, this concise, accessible introduction to the teachings, practices, and historical development of Buddhism is an invaluable guide that will set the standard for years to come.</p></p><p>Much of what we hear about Buddhism today in the West focuses on its philosophy, and how it can change one's life. Throughout history, however, Buddhism's mythology, scriptures, heroes, and its promise for salvation from rebirth have been the Buddhist teachings that most people have known. Religion professor Donald Lopez has mastered a good deal of this immense lore and managed with <i>The Story of Buddhism</i> to get it into a manageable package. Rather than providing a chronological history or country-by-country breakdown, Lopez explores general topics, meandering through two-and-a-half millennia, from India to Japan. In sections such as "Monastic Life," "Tantra," and "Pilgrimage," he talks about the origins of each topic and its mainstream manifestations. In addition, he spices up his work with delectable, if occasionally bizarre, examples from specific cultures. There is, for instance, the story of the depraved man who, once having said the words "Lotus Sutra," was saved from Hell. And the tale of the practice called the "act of truth," in which a perfectly candid statement can have magical powers. Or the story of the monk who attempted to rescue some maggots by opening his own flesh for them. No doubt, Buddhism is interesting, but it takes a competent scholar and a good storyteller to get it just right. Lopez fills the bill. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>Donald S. Lopez Jr. is the Carl W. Belser Professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan. He is the author and editor of many books on Buddhism, including <em>Buddhism in Practice</em> and <em>Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West,</em> and key religious texts by His Holiness the Dalai Lama: <em>The Joy of Living and Dying in Peace, The Way to Freedom,</em> and <em>Awakening the Mind, Lightening the Heart.</em></p><h2>Bleach (3-in-1 Edition), Vol. 5: Includes vols. 13, 14 &amp; 15 (5)</h2><p>Bestselling paranormal action adventure series now available in a bargain omnibus edition<br><br>Ichigo Kurosaki never asked for the ability to see ghosts&#x2014;he was born with the gift.

Posing this question for his fellow Western intellectuals who inhabit just such a world, James C. Edwards investigates the loss of religion's traditional power in a culture characterized by what he calls "normal nihilism"&#x2014;a situation in which one's commitment to a particular set of values is all one really has, and in which traditional religion is only a means of interpretation used to preserve what one most cares about. Recognizing the important historical role of religion in making us the people we are, he seeks to establish a viable understanding of religion without traditional beliefs and within the context of contemporary skepticism. </p><p><em>The Plain Sense of Things</em> is a book more interested in the power of religion that in its truth and in what happens to that power when the claims to truth slacken their grip.</p></p><p><p>James C. Edwards is Professor of Philosophy at Furman University. He is the author of <em>Ethics Without Philosophy: Wittgenstein and the Moral Life</em> (1985) and <em>The Authority of Language: Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and the Threat of Philosophical Nihilism </em>(1990).</p>&#x201c;This is a book of wisdom that mines the fading of our past religious convictions to show how they might provide a way to go on in what Edwards wonderfully calls &#x2018;normal nihilism.'&#x201d;<p></p><p>&#x2014;Stanley Hauerwas, Duke University<br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Plain Sense of Things</i> is a wonderfully learned book that has much to teach us about Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Thoreau, and Stevens. But it is more than that because it includes passages of philosophical reflection that surpass in profundity and clarity some of the famous works it interprets. The book&#x2019;s central question is what it means to accept fully and acknowledge honestly the contingency of whatever there is. James Edwards somehow manages to address this question thoughtfully and intelligibly without resorting to the cant, posturing, and hubris one so often finds these days in other writers who concern themselves with &#x2018;nihilism&#x2019; or &#x2018;the death of God.'&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;Jeffrey Stout, Princeton University</p></p><h2>Life of an Anarchist: The Alexander Berkman Reader</h2><p>Alexander Berkman was a twentieth-century American revolutionary. Like the abolitionist John Brown before him, Berkman was hugely idealistic, ready to go to the furthest extreme of self-sacrifice and violence on behalf of justice and civil rights. He decided to assassinate industrialist Henry Clay Frick after reading in the newspaper that Pinkertons hired by Frick had opened fire on the Homestead strikers, killing men, women, and children. Berkman&#x2019;s bungled attempt cost him fifteen years in a federal penitentiary. Upon his release, he became an effective agitator against conscription and was again imprisoned and eventually deported to Russia, where he saw at first hand the early days of Bolshevism. Berkman&#x2019;s writings remain a lasting and impassioned record of intense political transformation. <br>Featuring a new introduction by Howard Zinn, Life of an Anarchist contains Prison Memoirs of an Anarchist, Berkman&#x2019;s account of his years in prison; The Bolshevik Myth, his eyewitness account of the early days of the Russian Revolution; and The ABC of Anarchism, the classic text on the nature of anarchism in the twentieth century. Also included are a selection of letters between Berkman and his lifelong companion Emma Goldman, and a generous sampling from Berkman&#x2019;s other publications.</p><p>GENE FELLNER is an activist and artist living in Jersey City, New Jersey, where he edits and illustrates the GLF Occasional. He has been a staffworker for the Attica Brothers Legal Defense and a founder of the Cold Type Organizing Committee. In 1987 he was named Distinguished Artist by the New Jersey State Council for the Arts.A failed assassin, anarchist, lover of Emma Goldman and clear-eyed critic of the Russian revolution, Alexander Berkman (1870-1936) immersed himself in the political passions of his time, and this rich collection of his writings revives his witness. During the Homestead Strike of 1892, Berkman attempted to assassinate industrialist Henry Frick; excerpts from his somewhat melodramatic prison memoirs show Berkman's lofty idealism matured during his 14-year term. Selections from his magazine, The Blast, argue urgently against war and for birth control, worker unity and free speech. Most valuable are Berkman's accounts of Russia, where he was deported in 1919, and which he left two years later. His initial optimism was quickly tempered by glimpses of an autocratic regime, especially the repression of workers at Kronstadt. Also included are Berkman's naively faithful primer The ABC of Anarchism, and several letters to and from Goldman. In one exchange, they debate the value of violence; in another, Goldman calls Berkman "the greatest force in my life." Fellner, an activist and artist who edits the GLF Occasional , has selected and annotated the entries well. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Walt Disney: An American Original</h2><p>Walt Disney is an American hero--the creator of Mickey Mouse, and a man who changed the face of American culture.

The suburbs of southern Florida were row after row of single-level ranch houses and manicured lawns. I was eleven, filled with restless, inexplicable feelings. It was just before the dawn of puberty. Except for what I could glean from my brother&#x2019;s dirty magazines, sex was still an abstraction. Some other secret thing was beckoning. I had caught glimpses when I heard the music coming from his room, so different from my own small collection of Bay City Rollers and Bee Gees 45s. One by one, I began to play his records, holding the sleeves in my lap, trying to learn the grammar of this new musical language. I was not quite prepared for what I found. His music made me feel hot and cold at the same time, a small fire starting in my belly while shivers ran up my spine. Here was a seductive and impenetrable catalogue of arcane and occult symbols, of magic and mystical pursuits, of strange rituals involving sex, spaceships, and faeries. I went into his room looking to hear some real rock and roll. I came out spellbound and hypnotized by the spectacle.</p><p>The record collection was a lexicon of the gods: the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Arthur Brown, King Crimson, Hawkwind, Yes, Black Sabbath, and Pink Floyd. Already immersed in the arcana of the 1970s by way of J. R. R. Tolkien reprints, Dungeons &amp; Dragons&#x2014;almost universally known as D&amp;D&#x2014;<i>Heavy Metal</i> magazine, horror comics, and the animated films of Ralph Bakshi, I sat in long hours of deep listening, studying the lyrics, the album cover art, and even the hidden messages etched into the inner ring of the vinyl. I searched for the clues to Paul McCartney&#x2019;s rumored death and felt the chill of ghosts staring out from the cover of <i>Abbey Road</i>, the barefoot Beatle unwittingly symbolizing his own demise through some terrible necromancy. I held the vinyl of <i>Led Zeppelin III</i> up to the light so I could search for the fabled occult missive carved into the record&#x2019;s inner ring: &#x201c;Do what thou wilt.&#x201d; I stared in nervous fascination at the various characters inhabited by David Bowie and tried to crack the mystery of his lyrics that told of aliens, Aleister Crowley, and supergods who are &#x201c;guardians of a loveless isle.&#x201d; Black Sabbath was formed by sorcerers, working their dark art through heavy doom-laden riffs. Arthur Brown admitted he was the &#x201c;god of hellfire.&#x201d;</p><p>The music became a fixture of my psyche. I thought I alone had uncovered a well of arcane truth, like the paperback <i>Necronomicon</i> that sat on my bookshelf. There was something both transcendent and abysmal lurking within the grooves of these records and the fantastic lives of the characters inhabiting them. Roger Dean&#x2019;s artwork on Yes albums were landscapes once populated by ancient races, their arcane wisdom lost, sunken like Atlantis. At the other end of the spectrum was the Beatles&#x2019; impenetrable and terrifying penultimate song on the <i>White Album</i>, &#x201c;Revolution 9,&#x201d; a spoken-word, feedback-infused collage of hidden occult messages suggesting a palpable violence. These often opposing qualities nonetheless shared a common thread: they referenced a reality beyond normal perception, a vast metaverse inhabited by demons and angels, aliens and ancient sorcerers, all of which could be accessed by potentially dangerous methods such as magic, drugs, and maybe even sex. But I also sensed the peril in reading too deeply into these songs and albums. The film <i>Helter Skelter</i>, often shown on the UHF channels&#x2019; late-night movie programs, taught me that fixating on a band&#x2019;s life and work can sometimes take a fanatical turn. In this instance, an album helped to precipitate a murderous call to arms when Charles Manson believed the Beatles were sending him secret, violent messages through their music. Although the connection between the music and the murders was overblown, my adolescent self couldn&#x2019;t shake the feeling there <i>was something</i> to the Beatles&#x2019; songs that made this kind of interpretation possible. And sure, it was crazy to think so and everyone knew it wasn&#x2019;t true, but maybe, just maybe&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Paul really was dead.</p><p>Despite my ambivalence about my teenage fantasies, my brother&#x2019;s albums really were a glimpse into the sometimes explicit, sometimes hidden occult language of rock, a window into the pervasive influence of magic and mysticism on the most essential and influential art form of the twentieth century. Within a single collection representing a microcosm of rock history and styles was another hidden story, of how rock&#x2014;its songs and its staging, its lyrics and its pyrotechnics&#x2014;have been shaped by magical and mystical symbols, ideas, and practices.</p><p>Like many teenagers in those days, I wondered if magic really did exist outside the lists of spells in the D&amp;D <i>Player&#x2019;s Handbook</i>. I bought books on white magic and lit candles, making sure the window was open so as to not alert my mother, who was ever on the lookout for the danger of an open flame. My friends and I dimmed the lights and hovered our fingers over the plastic planchette of my Ouija board. Nothing seemed to manifest. I could not pull out of thin air the potent feelings that came from those records. There was magic here, but it was even bigger than I could have imagined. From between the gatefold covers, from the vinyl tucked snugly into the sleeves, an enchantment had been woven that bewitched all of popular culture.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t know it then, but I was a participant in a vast cultural phenomenon. The Beatles had already converted an entire generation of listeners whose ideas about spirituality would be shaped by LSD, tarot cards, and free copies of the Bhagavad Gita handed out by young Hare Krishna devotees. As I listened to <i>Houses of the Holy</i> in my brother&#x2019;s room, Led Zeppelin had already shaped rock&#x2019;s imagination about the power of the magical arts. And only a few years earlier, progressive rock bands had fashioned dreams of inner and outer space, offering otherworldly hope at the closing of the Aquarian dream.</p><p>Rock had used a cloak of glamour in the original use of the word: an enchantment. <i>Glamour</i> is even related to the word <i>grammar</i>, which was sometimes used to denote occult language, the verbal weaving of a spell, and eventually became <i>grimoire,</i> a book of magic. Just as in stage magic, where the audience allows itself to be tricked, to be seduced by the illusion, rock and roll has fed off a similar instinct. A person&#x2019;s willingness to be tricked is how the palm reader plies the trade, the shaman hypnotizes the tribe, and why I listened to those songs and gazed at those album covers in wonder and excitement, certain I was unlocking a chamber where a magical artifact was hidden.</p><p>Those days sitting cross-legged on my brother&#x2019;s floor were an initiation into a mystery cult, where I would become a disciple of rock and roll. Throughout my teenage years, rock was the musical narrative of my inner life. There was always an album that spoke perfectly to whatever inscrutable feelings I was negotiating at the time. Rock&#x2019;s often sphinxlike truths were the key to not only my own inner life; they could open the door into other mysterious realms. Eventually I stopped searching for esoteric riddles on album covers and in song lyrics, but I never ceased being aware of where the occult imagination was at play. It&#x2019;s a plot I&#x2019;ve been following ever since I first opened the gatefold cover to David Bowie&#x2019;s <i>Diamond Dogs</i> album to the grotesquely erotic painting of a caninesque Bowie, half man, half dog. I came to realize that magic cannot exist without a conduit, a means of expression. And even if it can, I am not interested in the metaphysics of the occult. I believe in those horned gods only when I hear them speaking from out of the grooves in the vinyl, the shiny surface of a CD, and even in the sonic reduction of the MP3. And in those moments they are as real as the music itself. I don&#x2019;t need the magic to be anywhere else. It exists as the most potent spell in the awesome spectacle of rock and roll.</p><p>II</p><p>At pivotal moments in its development, rock musicians and their audiences together made an almost unconscious pact to expand their consciousness and push beyond the restraints of traditional American music and its underlying spiritual identity. The occult became rock&#x2019;s very salvation then, taking possession of the imagination of rock musicians and their fans, and redefining popular music and culture. Moreover, the occult imagination saved rock and roll from sugary teenybopper purgatory and urged musicians, engineers, and producers to look beyond the conventional toward the possibility of raising the collective spiritual consciousness into the astral planes. The occult imbued rock with an immortal soul that continues to resonate in Western culture, and musicians and their audiences continue to feed off one another, looking for deeper meaning as a way to make sense of the primal and ancient urges that rock and roll has always evoked.</p><p>Rock is the sound of both spiritual and musical rebellion, and for the long and continuing history of this most indispensable of musical forms, these two things have become inseparable. What is it about rock, more than any other art form of the modern age, that makes it such a perfect vehicle for this ancient and often unconscious drive to penetrate the veil between the phenomenal world and the numinous realm of the spirit? Why have so many musicians staged their rock concerts to appear as moments of shamanic and religious rites and created personas simulating magicians, demons, the gods Pan and Dionysus, even appearing as people possessed by gods or devils or worse? Why have they covered their album covers with images of the occult, conjured their lyrics out of the stuff of legend and myth, and even in their personal lives sought their own mystical and magical experiences? Why have they performed shows in front of ancient relics?</p><p>Rock&#x2019;s spiritual affinity with occultism is due in large part to the nature of the occult itself. The occult&#x2014;the popular term for a wide range of spiritual beliefs and activities concerned with supernatural, Gnostic, magical, and mystical ideas&#x2014;operates within an unorthodox, nonconformist, and sometimes heretical temple, worshipping in ways at odds with the traditional and established religious order. These practices are an attempt by the individual or group to take a more active role in their own spiritual destiny, to commune with the divine through some form of intercession. Spirits, divination, amulets, charms, and even the worship of other deities feel direct and experiential.</p><p>This purposeful drive toward a divine encounter has surfaced in various manifestations throughout history and all over the world: in the Jewish mystics of medieval Europe, in the American Pentecostal Christians, and in the American appropriation of Buddhism and yoga. Christianity would often see this impulse as the work of the devil, even within its own ranks. Renaissance magicians and alchemists such as Giordano Bruno were called heretics, and later Lutheran and other American Christian sects would look on snake handlers and those who spoke in tongues as liars at best, devil worshippers at worst. In many cases, it was Christianity that perpetuated a belief in a pagan lineage through laws against magic and more active and often false accusations such as the infamous witch trials. The use of occult fears for political gains only prolonged superstitions and the other beliefs that religious authorities claimed to be trying to eradicate. Christianity would seal the pagan chamber completely, even as it defined itself by appropriating pagan myths such as the solstice and a resurrecting god. As the instinct for ecstatic experience continued to bubble up, it became by definition heterodox. The original intention of this kind of authentic practice, once organized around communities with rituals bordering on the theatrical and the hypnotic, was mostly lost.</p><p>Until rock and roll.</p><p>The phenomenon is modern, but rock&#x2019;s soul was burnished in the fires of ancient mystery cults, when myth and initiation were fused in a potent mix of dance, intoxication, and other forms of ecstatic revelry. But despite the spectacle of this kind of worship, it&#x2019;s still a simple human need being played out in theatrical ways: it&#x2019;s the desire for community, for myth and ritual, and for direct communion with the divine.</p><p>It&#x2019;s best to imagine the occult roots of rock as an estuary. While early rock and roll can be traced directly to the blues, gospel, and folk, rock&#x2019;s overall development was also shaped by jazz, experimental and early electronic music, and even classical strains. In each of these influences the occult is also present, often exhibiting the same characteristic: artists looking for ways to revolt against convention by using the occult as both an inspiration and a vehicle for their ideas. While rock is essentially a recent phenomenon, it does not exist in a vacuum of modern human experience. Rock is an aspect of the ancient impulse to hammer out sounds on whatever tools are available, to express what it means to be human. For millennia, making music has been inseparable from religious activity. Rock and roll&#x2019;s origins are in the blues and folk&#x2014;forms of music deeply engrained with Christian traditions and values, but whose own roots grew in the soil where other gods were worshipped. As popular music developed, it struggled with this tension between Puritanism and the shadow of other non-Christian traditions that were just as much a part of American music.</p><p>Just as religious traditions have always sought to make sense of their own pagan origins&#x2014;usually by prohibiting and demonizing the old gods&#x2014;ministers, parents, and record-burning mobs saw in rock the threat of sex and chaos. Rock&#x2019;s response was its true salvation: musicians pushed out further, conjuring spirits with power chords. When rock was finding its electric sound and its hormonal teenage audience, it chose sex as its expression of agitation. This was its first claim to autonomy, a wriggle of the hips in the face of the religious hierarchy. As rock critic Dan Graham explains: &#x201c;Rock turned the values of traditional religion on their head. To rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll meant to have sex&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. NOW.&#x201d; Because the mainstream church often saw sex as a symptom of ungodliness and the influence of evil spirits, rock musicians felt the good burn of rebellion as they plugged in their amps, calling out to a greater salvation than Christian redemption: &#x201c;When the chimes ring five, six, and seven, / We&#x2019;ll be right in seventh heaven.&#x201d;</p><p>Rock&#x2019;s erotic tension gave it the label of devil&#x2019;s music, its very soul seen as having been burnished in the fires of one of the first sins: human sexual awareness. Rock&#x2019;s first words were sexual, drawn from deeply explicit blues lyrics and the very physicality of its rhythms, themselves arising out of ancient soil. As the American slaves were developing their own form of Christianity that used song as the essential form of worship, they tread carefully even as they incorporated African tribal music and movement. Slaves would shuffle around in a...</p></p><h2>The Race of the Birkebeiners</h2><p>Offers the true story of the Birkebeiners, translated to the &#34;Birchleggers&#34;, who battled to restore peace to their country by saving the child prince from his snow-covered mountains of Norway in 1206.

Colwin died in 1992.CHAPTER 1 &nbsp; <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido Morris and Vincent Cardworthy were third cousins. No one remembered which Morris had married which Cardworthy, and no one cared except at large family gatherings when this topic was introduced and subjected to the benign opinions of all. Vincent and Guido had been friends since babyhood. They had been strolled together in the same pram and as boys were often brought together, either at the Cardworthy house in Petrie, Connecticut, or at the Morris's in Boston to play marbles, climb trees, and set off cherry bombs in trash cans and mailboxes. As teenagers, they drank beer in hiding and practiced smoking Guido's father's cigars, which did not make them sick, but happy. As adults, they both loved a good cigar. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At college they fooled around, spent money, and wondered what would become of them when they grew up. Guido in tended to write poetry in heroic couplets and Vincent thought he might eventually win the Nobel Prize for physics. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In their late twenties they found themselves together again in Cambridge. Guido had gone to law school, had put in several years at a Wall Street law firm, and had discovered that his heart was not in his work, and so he had come back to graduate school to study Romance languages and literature. He was old for a graduate student, but he had decided to give himself a few years of useless pleasure before the true responsibilities of adulthood set upon him. Eventually, Guido was to go to New York and take over the stewardship of the Morris family trust-the Magna ,Charta Foundation, which gave money to civic art projects, artists of all sorts, and groups who wished to preserve landmarks and beautify their cities. The trust put out a bimonthly magazine devoted to the arts called Runnymeade. The money for all this came from a small fortune in textiles made in the early nineteenth century by a former sea captain by the name of Robert Morris. On one of his journeys, Robert Morris had married an Italian wife. Thereafter, all Morrises had Italianate names. Guido's grandfather was Almanso. His father was Sandro. His Uncle Giancarlo was the present administrator of the trust but he was getting on and Guido had been chosen to be eventual heir. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vincent had gone off to the University of London and had come back to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He had begun as a city planner, but his true field of interest was sanitation engineering, as it was called, although Vincent called it garbage. He was fascinated by its production, removal, and possible uses. His monographs on recycling, published in a magazine called City Limits, were beginning to make him famous in his field. He had also patented a small machine for home use that turned vegetable peelings, newspapers, and other kitchen leavings into valuable mulch, but nothing much had happened to it. Eventually he would go off to New York and give over his talent and energy to the Board of City Planning. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With their futures somewhat assured, they lolled around Cambridge and wondered whom they would marry. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One Sunday afternoon in January, Vincent and Guido found themselves perusing an exhibition of Greek vases at the Fogg Museum. The air outside was heavy and wet. Inside, it was overheated. It was the sort of day that forced you out of the house and gave you nothing back in return. They had been restless indoors, edgy out of doors, and had settled on the Fogg feeling that the sight of Greek vases might cool them out. They took several turns around. Guido delivered himself of a lecture on shape and form. Vincent gave his two minutes on the planning of the Greek city-state. None of this quieted them. They were looking for action, unsure of what kind and unwilling to seek it out. Vincent believed that the childish desire to kick tires and smash bottles against walls was never lost but relegated, in adulthood, to the subconscious where it jumped around creating just the sort of tension he was feeling. A sweaty round of handball or a couple of well-set cherry bombs would have done them both a lot of good, but it was too cold for the one and they were too refined for the other. Thus they were left with their own nerves. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the way out, Guido saw a girl sitting on a bench. She was slender, fine-boned, and her hair was the blackest, sleekest hair Guido had ever seen. It was worn the way Japanese children wear theirs, only longer. Her face seemed to print itself on his heart indelibly. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He stopped to stare at her and when she finally looked back, she glared through him. Guido nudged Vincent and they moved toward the bench on which she sat. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The perspective is perfect," said Guido. &#x201c;Notice the subtlety of line and the intensity of color." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Very painterly," said Vincent. &#x201c;What is it?" <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'll have to look it up," said Guido. &#x201c;It appears to be an inspired mix of schools. Notice that the nose tilts-a very slight distortion giving the illusion of perfect clarity." He pointed to her collar. &#x201c;Note the exquisite folds around the neck and the drapery of the rest of the figure." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During this recitation, the girl sat perfectly still. Then, with deliberation, she lit a cigarette. &nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the arc of the arm," Guido continued. The girl opened her perfect mouth. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Notice the feeblemindedness that passes for wit among aging graduate students," she said. Then she got up and left. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next time Guido saw her, she was getting on the bus. The weather had become savagely cold and she was struggling to get change out of her wallet but her gloves were getting in her way. Finally, she pulled off one of her gloves with her teeth. Guido watched, entranced. She wore a fur hat and two scarves. As she came down the aisle, Guido hid behind his book and stared at her all the way to Harvard Square, which was, it turned out, their common destination. They confronted each other at the newsstand. She looked him up and down and walked away. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two weeks later she turned up under more felicitous circumstances. She appeared at a tearoom with a girl named Paula Pierce-Williams, whom Guido had known all his life. Paula waved at him, and he ambled over to their table. &nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Guido, this is Holly Sturgis," said Paula. &#x201c;And Holly, this is Guido Morris." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;We've met," said Holly Sturgis. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I never see you anymore, Guido," said Paula. &#x201c;Are you still working on your thesis?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I'm almost finished," said Guido. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I can never remember what it's on," said Paula. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Medieval property law and its relationship to courtly love," said Guido. Holly Sturgis snickered. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido was not in the habit of falling in love with girls he saw on buses or in museums. He had had two serious love affairs and a small number of casual encounters. These he tried not to think about-they had puzzled and hurt him. He explained to himself that he was an old-fashioned man living in modern times, shackled with the belief that all real love affairs led to marriage. If they did not, they must in some way be bogus, built on bad faith or lack of true emotion. Therefore they were bad-once they were over, no matter how ardently one had begun them. The casual encounters Guido chalked up to sheer impulse. You could not call something that lasted for a day a love affair. Vincent tried to explain that these things were a matter of process-the process of growing up, but this was no consolation to Guido. In the case of his two serious love affairs, the partings had been equitable but not understandable: both the girls had married and sent him cards at Christmastime. Where, he wondered, had all that feeling gone?&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Now as he entered his thirties, he believed that one made mistakes in love until one was perfectly sure. That surety found its object in Holly Sturgis. He was serious in matters of the heart, and serious in matters of aesthetics. Something about Holly Sturgis struck him profoundly. One look announced her elegance and precision. Everything about her the calculation of her nloves, the grace with which she walked, the fact that she took off her gloves with her teeth-moved him. He believed that desire was mere shorthand for aesthetics and intuition. He wanted Holly Sturgis, plain and simple. He wanted access to that sleek, vital Japanese hair. He wanted her naked in his naked arms. He imagined that her shoulders smelled coolly of jasmine. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the way of people who fantasize rather than analyze, he knew that Holly was probably difficult, quirky, and hard to live with. It was obvious that she was precise-even her hair was precise. He knew all this because his daydreams were usually accurate-Vincent said he was a visual thinker. And so he imagined himself and Holly lying against crisp white sheets at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. He did not bother to imagine how they got there or what led up to it. There would be anemones on the night table. Holly's hair would look like a sable paintbrush against the pillow and in his daydream she was smoking, balancing the ashtray on her stomach. The late afternoon light would be fuzzy with smoke. She would be entirely silent. He, of course, would be consumed by the event -it would be the first time they had been to bed together- and he saw himself looking cautiously at Holly, but unable to tell what that lovely, intelligent face was expressing or concealing from view. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paula Pierce-Williams poured the tea. Then she went off to make a telephone call. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you engineer this?" Holly said. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Certainly not," said Guido. &#x201c;I can't help it if you follow me around." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't find that amusing. What do you want?" &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I want you to be more gracious to people who fall at your feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I don't notice you falling at my feet." &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Maybe you don't know how to look," said Guido. He saw Paula walking toward them and quickly asked Holly to have dinner with him. To his astonishment, she said yes. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their first encounter did not take place at the Ritz-Carlton, but at Holly's. The anemones Guido had daydreamed about were a series of ferns that hung above her bed and got into his eyes when he sat up. The sheets were crisp, but not white. They were printed with violets. The pillowcases were decorated with blue roses. Holly was smoking and the ashtray balanced on her stomach was a little Wedgwood plate decorated with black vines. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly's apartment was white and airy and it was as precise as Guido had imagined. Holly made small, absolute arrangements of things. On a white table was a bird's nest, an Egyptian figure in blue stone, a Russian match box, and a silver inkwell. The bed, before they had rumpled it, was made so that you could roll a dime across it. The sheets and pillows smelled of lavender. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was better than a daydream, better than those highly ornate night dreams that leave behind a sweet taste of inexplicable happiness in the morning. Guido turned to Holly and touched her dark, shining hair. She was wearing coral earrings the size of tuxedo studs and nothing else. It was a cold, rainy Saturday afternoon in late March, and Guido felt quite wiped out by sensation. Everything seemed uncommonly rich to him: the print on the sheets, the pattern on the quilt, Holly's gleaming hair and earrings. Her shoulders did smell of jasmine. When Guido turned to look at her, he saw on her face the look he had known he would see-a look so private and impenetrable and unclear that it rendered anything he thought of to say inappropriate. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holly was the granddaughter of old Walker Sturgis, who had taught classics. Her father was an executive in a copper company and her mother wrote historical novels for children. She was an only child, an only grandchild, and she was nearly perfect. She had her own ways, Holly did. She decanted everything into glass and on her long kitchen shelves were row upon row of jars containing soap, pencils, cookies, salt, tea, paper clips, and dried beans. She could tell if one of her arrangements was off by so much as a sixteenth of an inch and she corrected it. She was constantly fighting off the urge to straighten paintings in other people's houses. In her own house, her collection of botanical watercolors was absolutely straight. The shoes in her closet were stuffed with pink tissue paper and her drawers were filled with lavender sachet. In each corner of her closet hung a pomander ball. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked to have tea on a tray and she was fond of unmatched china. The tray she brought to Guido held cups that bore forget-me-nots, a lily-of-the-valley sugar dish, a cream pitcher with red poppies, and a teapot covered with red roses and cornflowers. This tray, when set on the bed, contributed to Guido's sensory overload. He was touched to think that this effort had been made on his behalf, but when he got to know Holly better he learned that she made up identical trays for herself when she studied. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guido had wondered if she knew how to cook. Her slight air of otherworldliness suggested that she did not, while her precision indicated that she did-in the way the Japanese did. He expected a dinner that looked like a painting. It turned out that she was a real marvel. Guido was surprised by the sheer deliciousness of it: food that good must, he felt, spring from a truly charitable, loving spirit. But charity did not seem to be in Holly's immediate emotional vocabulary. After a spectacular afternoon in bed, they had spent the rest of the day in polite half silence. Therefore, dinner almost did him in. Not only did it taste wonderful, it looked wonderful. Guido pegged Holly as a strong domestic sensualist. She had a positive genius for comfort but he was only a visitor: that comfort had been created long before he met her. &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He spent a sleepless night next to her, very much aware, even when he dozed, that he was sleeping in a stranger's bed. &nbsp; He dreamed brief, disconnected dreams and woke suddenly, unsure of where he was. The sight of Holly did not immediately locate him-she seemed so dreamlike and unapproachable. He spent a long time gazing at her and realized that he did not want to go to sleep. He did not want to miss a minute of her. &nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But he did sleep, and when he woke...</p><h2>Rihannsu: The Bloodwing Voyages (Star Trek: The Original Series)</h2><p><b>THE HISTORIC SAGA BEGINS</b> <br> <br> Born in the twilight years of Vulcan's violent and passionate past, those who declared themselves <i>Rihannsu</i> chose to reign free in the unknown reaches of space rather than to serve under the new tyranny of logic. Having severed themselves from their homeworld, they survived the perilous voyage across the stars to wash ashore on a distant planet, there to begin the civilization that would one day flower into the Romulan Star Empire. <br> <br> Now, after millennia of wars and conquests, that empire is decaying from within, surrendering its noble heritage to reckless ambition, abandoning honor for kidnapping and murder. The corruption is so great that the Rihannsu's finest military officer -- Commander Ael t'Rllaillieu of the warbird <i>Bloodwing</i> -- believes she can save her people only by joining forces with her greatest enemy: Captain James T. Kirk of the <i>Starship Enterprise</i>&#x2122;. <br> <br> Meanwhile, on the Romulan homeworld, a Federation deep-cover agent has been posing as a household servant named Arrhae i-Khellian -- but her operation takes a strange turn when a captured Starfleet officer is brought to her home . . . <br> <br> The lives of Ael, Arrhae, and the crew of the <i>Enterprise</i> come together in these astonishing adventures -- originally published in four volumes: <i>My Enemy, My Ally; The Romulan Way; Swordhunt</i>; and <i>Honor Blade</i> -- that will challenge everything you thought you knew about the Romulans.</p><p>Diane Duane is the author of <i>The Door Into Fire</i>, which was nominated for the World Science Fiction Society&#x2019;s John W.

Her rank, in the common tongue, was <i>khre'Riov</i>: commander-general. Her serial number was a string of sixteen characters that by now she knew as well as she knew her fourth name, though they meant infinitely less to her. And considering these matters in such a fashion was at least marginally appropriate just now, for she was in a trap. </p><p> How long she would remain there, however, remained to be seen. </p><p> At the moment her patience was mostly intact, but her spirit had moved her to rattle the bars of the cage a bit. Ael propped her elbow on her desk, rested her chin on her hand, and said to her cabin's wall screen, "<i>Hwaveyiir. Erein tr'Khaell</i>." </p><p> The screen flicked on, and there was the bridge, and poor Ante-centurion tr'Khaell just as he had been twenty minutes ago, still hunched over and pretending to fiddle with his communications boards. At the sight of Ael he straightened quickly and said, "Ie, khre'Riov?" </p><p> <i>Don't play the innocent with</i> me, <i>child</i>, thought Ael. <i>You should have had that dispatch decoded and translated ten minutes ago . . . as well you know. "Erein, eliukh hwio' 'ssuy llas-mene arredhaud'eitroi?</i>" </p><p> She said it politely enough, but the still, low-lidded look she gave him was evidently making it plain to tr'Khaell that if Ael had to ask him again about what was holding up the dispatch's deciphering, it would go hard with him. Sweat broke out on tr'Khaell's forehead. "Ie, khre'Riov, sed ri-thlaha nei' yhreill-ien ssuriu mnerev dhaarhiin-emenorriul -- " </p><p> <i>Oh indeed! I know how fast that computer runs; I was building them with my own hands before you knew which end to hold a sword by. Of course, you can't just come out and tell me that the security officer ordered you to let her read the dispatch before I saw it, now can you? "Rhi siuren, Erein."</i> </p><p> Poor tr'Khaell's face gave Ael the impression that t'Liun was going to take rather longer than "five minutes" to read the dispatch. Tr'Khaell looked panic-striken. "Khre'Riov -- " he started to say. But "<i>Ta'khoi</i>," Ael said to the screen, and it flicked off. </p><p> <i>Pitiable</i>, Ael thought. <i>Truly I could feel sorry for him. But if he chooses to sell his loyalty to two commanders at once, who am I to deprive him of the joy of being caught between them? Perhaps he'll learn better</i>. And after a second she laughed once, softly, as much at herself as at tr'Khaell. <i>Perhaps the galaxy will stop rotating</i>. </p><p> She pushed away from the desk and leaned back in her comfortable chair, considering with calm irony how little her surroundings looked like the cage they actually were. <i>They truly think they've deceived me</i>, she thought, amused and contemptuous, looking around at the spare luxury of her command cabin. <i>Pad the kennel with velvets, they say to each other; feed the old</i> thrai <i>on fat flesh and blood wine, put her in command of a fleet, and she won't notice that the only ones who pay any attention to her orders are the ones stuck inside the bars with her</i>. Ael's lips curled slightly upward at the thought. "<i>Susse-thrai</i>" had been the name bestowed upon her, half in anger, half in affection, by her old crew on <i>Bloodwing</i>; the keen-nosed, cranky, wily old she-beast, never less dangerous than when you thought her defenseless, and always growing new teeth far back in her throat to replace the old ones broken in biting out the last foe's heart. You might cage a <i>thrai</i>, you might poke it through the bars and laugh; but it would find a way to be avenged for the insult. It would break out and tear off your leg and eat it before your face -- or run away and wait till you had died of old age, then come back and excrete on your grave. </p><p> Then Ael frowned at herself, annoyed. "Crude," she said to the room, eyes flicking up to the ceiling-corner by the bed as she wondered whether t'Liun had managed to bug the place already since last week. "I grow crude, as they do." <i>Chew on that, you vacuum-headed creature, and wonder what it means</i>, thought Ael, getting up to pace her cage. </p><p> The most annoying part was that it was true. That courtesy, honor, noble behavior should be cast aside by the young, perceived as a useless hindrance to expediency, was bad enough. But that she should begin to sink to their level herself, descending into brute-beast metaphors and savagery instead of the straightforward dealing that had been tradition for four thousand years of civilization -- that was galling. <i>I will not fight them with their own methods</i>, Ael thought. <i>That is the surest way to become them. I will come by my victories honestly. And as for Sunseed</i> -- </p><p> She stopped in front of another of her cabin's luxuries, one better than private 'fresher or sleeping silks or key lighting. Beyond the wide port, space yawned black, with stars burning in it -- stars that at <i>Cuirass</i>'s present sublight speed hung quite still, apparently going nowhere. <i>As I am</i>, she thought, but the thought was reflex, and untrue. Ael grimaced again and leaned her forehead against the cool clearsteel. </p><p> In one way, she had no one to blame for where she was right now but herself. When she had heard about the Sunseed project based at Levaeri V, and had begun to realize what it could do to Rihannsu civilization if fully implemented, shock and horror had stung her into swift action. She had taken leave from <i>Bloodwing</i> and gone home to ch'Rihan to lobby against the project -- openly speaking out against it in the Senate, and privately making the rounds of her old political cronies, all those old warrior-Senators and those few comrades in the Praetorate who owed her favors. However, Ael had not realized the extent to which the old warriors were being outweighed, or in some cases subverted or cowed, by the young ones -- the hot-blooded children who wanted everything right now, who wanted the easy, swift victories that the completion of Sunseed would bring them. Honorless victories, against helpless foes; but the fierce young voices now rising in the Senate cared nothing about that. They wanted safety, security, a world without threats, a universe in which they could swoop down on defenseless ships or planets and take what they wanted. </p><p> <i>Thieves</i>, Ael thought. <i>They have no desire to be warriors, fighting worthy foes for what they want, and winning or losing according to their merits. They want to be robbers, like our accursed allies the Klingons. Raiders, who stab in the back and loot men's corpses, or worlds. And as for those of us who remember an older way, a better way, they wait for us to die. Or in some cases, they hurry us along</i>. . . . </p><p> She pushed herself away from the cool metal of the port, breathed out once. Somewhere among those stars, out in that blackness, ch'Rihan and ch'Havran hung, circling one another majestically in the year's slow dance around amber Eisn; two green-golden gems, cloud-streaked, seagirt, burning fair. But she would probably never walk under those clouds again, or beside those seas, as a result of that last visit to the sigil-hung halls of the Senate. The young powers in the High Command, suspicious of Ael from the first, now knew for sure that she was opposed to them, and their reaction to her opposition had been swift and thorough. They dared not exile her or murder her, not openly; she was after all a war hero many times over, guilty of no real crime. Instead they had "honored" her, having Ael sent out on a long tour of duty, into what was ostensibly a post of high command and great peril. Command she wielded, but with eyes watching her, spies of various younger Senators and Praetors. And as for peril . . . it came rarely, but fatally, here in the Outmarches -- the deadly peaceful space that the power surrounding most of it called the Romulan Neutral Zone. </p><p> <i>Names</i>, Ael thought with mild irony, <i>names . . . How little they have to do with the truth, sometimes</i>. The great cordon of space arbitrarily thrown about Eisn was hardly neutral. At best it was a vast dark hiding-place into which ships of both sides occasionally dodged, preparing for intelligence-gathering forays on the unfriendly neighbor. As for "Romulan" -- after first hearing the word in Federation Basic, rather than by universal translator, Ael had become curious to understand the name the Empire's old foes had given her world, and had done some research into it. She had been distastefully fascinated to find the word's meaning rooted in some weird Terran story of twin brothers abandoned in the wild, and there discovered and given suck by a brute beast rather like a <i>thrai</i>. It would take a Terran to think of something so bizarre. </p><p> But whether one called Eisen's paired worlds ch'Rihan and ch'Havran or Romulus and Remus, Ael knew she was unlikely to ever walk either of them again. <i>Never again to walk through Airissuin's purple meads</i>, she thought, gazing out at the starry darkness. <i>Never to see that some loved one had hung up the name-flag for me; never to climb Eilairiv and look down on the land my mothers and fathers worked for a thousand years, the lands we held with the plowshare and the sword</i> . . . For the angry young voices in the Senate, Mrian and Hei and Llaaseil and the rest, had put her safely out of their way; and here, while they held power, she would stay. They would wait and let time do what their lack of courage or some poor tattered rag of honor forbade them. </p><p> Accidents happened in the Neutral Zone, after all. Ships far from maintenance suddenly came to grief. That was likely enough, in this poor secondhand warbird with which they'd saddled her, this flying breakdown looking for a place to happen. Crews rebelled against discipline, mutinied, on long hauls . . . and that was likely too, considering the reprehensible lot of rejects and incompetents with whom she was trapped here. Ael thought longingly of her own...</p></p><h2>Honey in his Mouth</h2><p>Walter Harsh, a small-time grifter who&#39;s a lookalike for a South American dictator, gets dragged into a plot to steal the despot&#39;s ill-gotten wealth.</p><p><b>Lester Dent</b> created the pulp hero Doc Savage in 1933 and wrote more than 180 novels starring the famous Man of Bronze.

A mysterious man known only as Mr. Brother recruits Harsh and his girlfriend and sidekick, Vera Sue Crosby, into a complex scam involving a South American strongman's beautiful former mistress, a corrupt physician and an Arab financial mastermind. As the plotters await political chaos and the Peron-like dictator's flight from his country, Harsh prepares to impersonate the dictator as part of an embezzlement plot beyond his wildest imaginings. Originally written in 1956, Dent's story suffers from both an unlikely identical strangers premise and the casual sexism of its era, but the elaborate twists of the caper effectively draw the reader into a hard-boiled, violent and authentically gritty tale in the best pulp style. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

My mother worked there. In the summers I woke with her early and took the wooded trail near our home. She brought us breakfast, usually some bread with cold jam and butter, and halfway up the slope we found a spot with a view and rested.<br> <br>In the valley there was the town and the distant river. On some days we could see the train come up from the city, blowing smoke into the sky. South of this was our house and the horse farm my father was employed by. Sometimes I could even see my father cross a paddock; I recognized his strange gait, from when a horse kicked his hip before I was born.<br> <br>He came from a family of farriers. The house was one we rented from a wealthy Dutchman whom I never saw. It had four rooms on one floor. Our most valuable possession was a piano my mother owned. She used to play, before the first war. She had come to America to perform in a concert hall in Manhattan.<br> <br>Her name was Jos�phine. She was from France. She was supposed to be in the city for only a week. One afternoon she went to a market and my father was there, trying to sell old horseshoes to the children, for their games.<br> <br>My father, who was too shy to speak to anyone, slipped one around her wrist as she browsed. She looked up, startled by the gesture and his boldness, the unexpected weight of the shoe, then the iron, which quickly warmed against her. It startled him, too, because he had never done something like that before.<br> <br>They didn&#x2019;t see each other again until a few days later, at the same stall, when she returned, her fingers stiff from repeating a phrase on the piano all morning. She had wanted to look at his face one more time. He smelled like hay and fire.<br> <br>She never returned home. She followed him north and tried to make a life with him in the Hudson Valley, both of them in their twenties, with the barrier of language between them, and only the faith of some attraction they held on to for as long as they could.<br> <br>Jos�phine gave lessons here. They had me.<br> <br>Then, in 1914, everything changed. She heard about France on the radio. She wanted to do something. I used to think that if she could, she would have gone back. But she didn&#x2019;t. She pulled away from my father instead. I never discovered what caused this or whether they themselves could have articulated it. But they drifted apart, quietly, over time, as I grew older, creating separate lives, separate rhythms to their days.<br> <br>My father I saw less of. He took on more work in the farms across the valley and came back well into evening. Years later, in those times when I would think of him, it was never his face I recalled but his shape in the distance, in the field, as he went to shoe a horse. Or the way his arm hung over the chair as he fell asleep, the book he was trying to read slipping from his hand and dropping. How I would pick the book up, sit on the floor with his palm on my head, and wait for the twitch of some dream, imagining what world he had found himself in as I listened to his steady breathing.<br> <br>It was my mother I spent most days with. Helping her around the house. Going into town with her to buy draperies for the windows. My love, help, she would say, and I rushed to collect the gauzy fabric that spilled from her arms like old sails. And when she began to volunteer at the sanatorium, she took me, and I watched as, through the years, she helped the patients and later the North American wounded who were sent up from the city, along the river, and transported here by trucks, to be closer to home, to recover, to die.<br> <br> � <br> <br>I outlived her. How was that possible? I never knew what made her, in a slow descent over the years, begin to use the medicine she gave to the patients at the sanatorium. What it was she hid or kept from me and my father.<br> <br>But I loved being with her then. I loved watching her work. Her patience and charm with strangers. Her uniform, and her dark hair I didn&#x2019;t inherit, pinned up. Up there, she laughed easily. She was gregarious. She sang French songs for the convalescents and for me.<br> <br>And I loved, almost as much, the sanatorium itself, which was tall and endless, with all its windows and dormers, the heavy curtains and the chandeliers like some old palace. The rocking chairs on the porch, which faced a lake. And Theo, who would come down from the house that was connected to the main building, carrying a towel the size of a bed over his shoulder, to take me swimming.<br> <br>Theo was the son of the resident physician. They were British but had come here when he was an infant, their father working first in the city. No one knew where his mother was. They had already been at the sanatorium by the time my mother began to volunteer. Theo and I were around the same age and we often sought each other&#x2019;s company on the mountain, the two of us floating on our backs in the lake, wondering about what was happening in France.<br> <br>He was smaller than I was, but he moved like a dancer to me. Light-footed and assured as we explored the floors of the building, hunting for ghosts and secret passageways. He liked to show me the patients that terrified him. A man with strange scars across his chest; another who couldn&#x2019;t stop coughing and spitting up blood. He would bend down toward the keyhole, his long bangs falling over his eyes, and peer in.<br> <br>Eventually, my mother found us, kissed Theo and me, and she and I headed back down before it grew dark. Theo, like a gentleman, always walked us to the start of the trail, watched from there, and waved.<br> <br>I never saw him leave the mountain. It didn&#x2019;t occur to me to think of that as odd then. He was always Theo on the mountain, as my mother called him. Like she had done for me, she taught him some French. Brought him pastries from the town.<br> <br>Later, I heard he was sick. An incurable illness. I never found out what it was or if this was true. He was strong to me. Bright-eyed. He dove often and first into the lake. Held his breath the longest. Ran across the lawn the fastest. But one day he didn&#x2019;t appear outside. And I didn&#x2019;t see him the next day either. And when I hadn&#x2019;t seen him in a long time, I was told he had gone away. Him and his father both. No one seemed to know where, not even my mother.<br> <br>A new physician moved in. The days grew colder. I wrapped myself in a blanket I had stolen from a ward and sat on the rocking chairs with the wounded who had begun to appear from France. One was named Henri Loze, but he went by Henry. He was Canadian. He let me hold his cigarette lighter. He spoke of the Argonne. He joked about the girls in Calais. About the one he met on a bridge who had followed him, trying to sell shoelaces, buttons, bottles, things taken from dead soldiers.<br> <br>Oh, her breasts, he said, and he began to cry, openmouthed, his shoulders shaking and his saliva dripping onto his blanket, which hid the fact that he was missing his legs.<br> <br>My mother appeared and gave him something&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t tell what&#x2014;and I saw her slip something else under the sleeve of her shirt as Henry called her by her name and, in the warm sunlight, calmed.<br> II.<p></p> <br>My father came up to the sanatorium a few times. He told me this in a letter once, many years later, saying good-bye. He used to watch as Theo and I followed the paths, caught in our own private worlds. And later, when I was older, he watched as I helped some patients into the boat so that they could row out across the lake. He said he liked seeing me in my uniform. He thought my mother would have liked seeing it, too.<br> <br>He never told me if he ever approached her while she was working or whether he simply stayed for a while at the edge of the property and climbed back down. Whether he ever continued on to the building and talked to anyone, curious about the place that perhaps still contained some part of my childhood and that had consumed his wife so deeply. He never told me if he ever found her in the corner of a room, erasing herself with the morphine she had continued to use and that, one day, she never woke from.<br> <br>Two orderlies found her. And then they came down, meeting my father in the field beside our house and, in a moment of grief I wasn&#x2019;t witness to, he beat them, nearly killing one.<br> <br>My father left not long after. I didn&#x2019;t know where he went. Just that he walked to the docks one night, got on a boat, and left the valley, his house, and the horses he had worked with all his life.<br> <br>I never saw him again. It was the start of the Second World War and I used to wonder if, like me, he had entered it somewhere, in some far continent. For a time, I checked lists and asked people passing through if they had seen him, or knew him, but no one ever did.<br> <br>I was in England during those years. I had joined the Red Cross, working for a hospital in London. I was almost thirty, unmarried, and I spent most days in the wards, doing what my mother had done, or wandering the streets, not yet accustomed to the city. There was a caf� near the hospital and from my window at night I would listen to faint music, sometimes a singer. I tried to name the caf� songs. I read again the only letter my father ever wrote to me, surprised that he had written at all, surprised that it arrived:<br> <br>The sanatorium closed. I think because of the war. Like you, all the doctors have gone. Tomorrow I will go up to the garden they were growing and take what is left of the vegetables. I am here in the room with the piano, noticing for the first time that it is missing a key. Was it always missing? Yesterday, I had a dream of you as a boy: I was in a chair and you were sitting on the floor beside me, leaning up into my hand.<br> <br> � <br> <br>The bombings started that fall. I disobeyed orders and stayed, living in the hospital basement for one hundred fifty days.<br> <br>More than anything, we cherished lightbulbs.<br> <br>Once, in a narrow corridor, a girl asked for my address. She had given me hers, slipped it into my shirt pocket.<br> <br>In case, she said.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t have time to give her mine. I hadn&#x2019;t even caught her name. She had reached for my shoulder, touched me as though playing a game. It was the lightest touch. Her eyes delirious in the dust and the blinking dark as she rushed by, pushing a wounded man against the wall to steady him, to operate on him.<br> <br>I took out the paper. An address in Montreal.<br> <br>I thought I saw her again during those one hundred fifty days. There was a six-inch window in the room I shared with seven others as we took turns trying to sleep. It was our only view out into a city that was being destroyed, hour by hour. We watched families attempt to scavenge whatever they could&#x2014;a cup, a radio, a window curtain&#x2014;as the cobblestone around them was pummeled. I saw the branch of a tree fly into the air and spear a woman&#x2019;s heart, catapulting her backward into a crater.<br> <br>Paper fell like snow.<br> <br>Across the courtyard, there was another window, where there were other doctors and nurses. The passage connecting the wings of the hospital had long ago collapsed, so we signaled to each other with candles, this brief joy at catching the blurred, lit shapes of other people&#x2019;s faces over the rubble.<br> <br>I thought I saw her there, her profile passing the windowpane. I waved. In a moment of quiet someone lifted her and she squeezed through the window and I watched her sprint, waving a flashlight. I wondered if she was looking for something or going to find help or running away. The light hit my eyes and I lost her.<br> <br>That night the statue in the courtyard fell and covered our window. We lost electricity. For the rest of the days we were strict with our candles in that room that smelled of our bodies and the earth. Ten minutes every evening to see each other and remind ourselves we were still there, and to write our letters. We had a gramophone and one undamaged record, Billie Holiday, so we listened to a song as we wrote.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know who to write to, so I wrote every night to Theo:<br> <br>1940&#x2013;1941<br> <br>Canada. I like the sound of that word in my mouth. It feels like a calm winter to me. A warm fire. A word to hold. Maybe my father&#x2019;s there. Maybe you are, too. One day I&#x2019;ll visit. I&#x2019;ll knock on your door with the pastries you love, the ones with the chocolate in the center.<br> <br>I want to see the landscape we tried to paint together&#x2014;you started with twilight; I put in a harbor and a small boat. Was it cruel to paint alongside the patients? I wonder. The ones who painted to pass the hours, to distract themselves from death. You never met Henry Loze. You would have liked him. He was funny and kind and told stories. He often held himself as though trying to vanish.<br> <br>I am starting to understand that instinct, when wounded, to find a small, dark space. Through the only window I see a narrow strip of sky and I wonder if that is enough. I am beginning to grow comfortable here in the dark. I am beginning to get used to the air. I wonder if I will ever step outside again. Maybe I was always here.<br> <br>I think we live in museums.<br> <br>There were once photographs on the walls of this building. Portraits. The faces of the first doctors. The countryside in the evening. A lake, low-lit. A willow and the moon. We burned them for fire.<br> <br>I keep thinking of your laughter. Which was like the snow. A note on the piano. The shape of air. We promised each other we would never steal from the pockets of the dead. I broke that promise here.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m losing track of time.<br> <br>Once in a fit of anger I broke off a key from my mother&#x2019;s piano and hid it in the sanatorium&#x2019;s attic. It must still be there. My mother never scolded me, even though she knew I was the one who had done it. She continued to play, masking that missing note.<br> <br>Theo, you first stole the morphine for her, didn&#x2019;t you? You thought it was a game. You would sneak into your father&#x2019;s office, unlock the cabinets, and come back to her, waiting for her to smile, waiting to feel her hand on your hair. I knew. But I&#x2019;m not angry about that. I think you knew you were dying. And you did everything you could to please everyone. You, who would never come down from that mountain. Only wave. As though there was something in your life, something deep and bright, that was never in mine.<br> <br>I saw you once leap into a rainstorm like an animal, like a swimmer, your wild body lit by lightning.<br> <br>I have come to think privacy is both sacred and sacrilege.<br> <br>Tonight, I don&#x2019;t remember my father. I look up at the window where a stone face, with a shattered eye, stares down.<br> III.<p></p> <br>It ended in the spring. I didn&#x2019;t leave right away. We found as many people as we could, or they found us, and we treated them. We swept, we cleaned. We repaired walls and windows. And then in the summer, as I was leaving the hospital on an errand, a family followed me out. Two children and their parents. They appeared dazed in the heat and the sun, unsure of where they were, what day it was, what year. They stayed close to me and didn&#x2019;t speak.<br> <br>I was supposed to pick up medicine from a mill that had been converted into a barracks. Instead, I took the children&#x2019;s hands and helped them over the rubble and around the wagons and the wheelbarrows.<br> <br>We saw the Thames. We followed the curve of the river, past town homes and fa...</p><h2>The Zoo</h2><p>An ordinary trip to the zoo turns out to be extraordinary... as an imaginative, fun-filled, animal adventure takes hold of a little girl. (Meanwhile, her poor beleaguered parents experience an adventure of their own.) It s a trip youngest animal lovers, explorers and dreamers will want to take again and again.</p><p>Suzy Lee is an artist and illustrator, born in Seoul, Korea. She received her BFA in painting from Seoul National University and her MA in Book Arts from Camberwell College of Arts, London. Her books and paintings have won numerous international awards and have been featured in exhibitions worlwide.Grade 2&#x2013;5&#x2014;A pleasant family outing takes a surreal turn. A little girl begins, "I went to the zoo with my mom and dad," then lists the various animals they visit. The pictures, however, tell another story. Somber gray and dark-blue-toned illustrations depict humans looking into empty cages. The girl darts away, following a peacock into a colored landscape. As her frightened parents search for her, the child plays with an increasing assortment of vividly hued animals before she is found sleeping on a bench. She finishes, "I love the zoo. It's very exciting. Mom and Dad think so too." Lee's illustrations, a complex mix of pastels, pen and ink, and collage, are full of intriguing details. At the beginning, the child is grayish like the rest of the landscape. When she is with the animals, she is depicted in color. Even after she rejoins her parents, her cheeks, coat, and single boot are a bright pink. The cover and endpaper illustrations contain important elements that inform one's interpretation of the events. Before the story begins, readers see an empty monkey house and an ape leaving through a hole in the fence to join other beckoning animals. The back cover shows the animal back in the monkey house, admiring a small pink boot. This sophisticated picture book may be best appreciated by older readers who are willing to explore its complicated visual images.&#x2014;<i>Lucinda Snyder Whitehurst, St. Christopher's School, Richmond, VA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Pho Xao <p>Fresh rice noodles are used for this dish, but 1 pound of dried rice sticks (banh pho) may be substituted. Toss the noodles with some oil just after boiling to prevent sticking, and then stir-fry as directed in the recipe. </p><p>Ideally, to sear both the noodles and the beef, a heavy cast-iron skillet should be used. Cast iron sears extremely well when hot, but it has to be smoking hot before the food is added. Be sure the ventilation fan is on. </p><p>Bok choy may be replaced by Chinese broccoli, cut into 2-inch sections, or simply used fresh spinach. </p><p>Ingredients: 1 recipe rice-noodle crepes (banh uot, page 224), or 2 pounds commercial fresh flat rice noodle sheets Nuoc Cham (page 212) 8 ounces beef chuck or rump roast 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce) 1/4 teaspoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper 1 medium onion, cut into eighths and separated into segments 4 large bok choy leaves, cut into 2 by 1-inch strips 4 ounces snow peas, trimmed 1 medium tomato cut into 8 wedges 2 scallions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch sections 1 tablespoon soy sauce 3 tablespoons oyster sauce 5 tablespoons peanut oil 8 garlic cloves, minced (about 2 tablespoons) Fresh coriander sprigs, for garnish Fresh red chile peppers, thinly sliced </p><p>If preparing your own fresh rice-noodle sheets, proceed as instructed.

Add 2 tablespoons of the peanut oil and half of the garlic; sit-fry until fragrant. Add the noodles and toss quickly until heated through, about 1 minute. Transfer the noodles to a large platter, keep warm. In the following step it is very important that while sauting the beef the heat be kept very high. Tilt the wok frequently into the area of highest heat to "flamb," or sear, the meat instantly, the smoker the beef, the better. If using an electric stove, turn the burner to the highest setting and saut the beef in two batches. </p><p>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil. When the oil is smoking, add the remaining garlic and stir-fry until aromatic. Add the beef and stir-fry for 30 seconds, until the beef is slightly pink. Remove the beef to a platter.

Mastermind of the legendary Brink's armored truck robbery and a string of countless other high-stakes heists, he stole more than ten million dollars in escapades that often were breathtakingly daring and at times marvelously inventive. The robberies baffled both police and fellow outlaws for decades, and most of the crimes remain unsolved today. Now the open case files of these memorable thefts can be closed as Cresta himself provides the true story on how they were planned and carried out.<br><br>Born in Boston's North End in 1928, Cresta was raised in an abusive household. He was sent to Concord Reformatory as a teenager, where he learned the craft of picking locks, a skill later honed during stays at the Charlestown and Walpole prisons in Massachusetts. Following the Brinks robbery in 1968, he was put on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, but eluded the law for five years, living in Chicago under an assumed name. After serving time at Walpole for the Brinks job, Cresta died penniless in Chicago in 1995. Yet shortly before his death, he revealed the full extent of his astonishing capers to coauthor Bill Crowley, a retired Boston police detective.<br><br>Drawing from their extensive conversations, this riveting page-turner chronicles how Cresta, along with partners "Angelo" and "Tony," pulled off robberies of jewelers, rare coin dealers, furriers, and armored trucks, detailing the meticulous planning that marked his criminal career. Cresta's final accounting is brimming with vivid tales of betrayal, murder, and intrigue as well as a colorful cast of characters, including mob bosses, wise guys, informants, paid "ears," corrupt judges, a Hollywood starlet, and even the Mayor of Chicago.<br><br>Filled with drama, tension, and humor, this absorbing saga takes the reader inside the dangerous yet exhilarating world of a life dedicated to crime.</p><p>BRIAN P. WALLACE is a former Massachusetts state representative. Bill Crowley is a retired Boston police detective.You wouldn't necessarily expect a true-crime book to be a whole lot of fun, but this one is. Like William Friedkin's 1978 film <i>The Brinks Job</i>, it's exciting, lighthearted, and completely realistic. As crime writer Dennis Lehane points out in his foreword, too many true-crime memoirs tend to present their subjects in a less-than-accurate light, trading on our <i>Godfather</i>-inspired perception of criminals as loyal, honorable, wealthy people. The truth, as the authors make abundantly clear here, is somewhat less glamorous. Phil Cresta and his cohorts were a band of thieves--very clever thieves, to be sure, but thieves nonetheless. They weren't particularly honorable, and they certainly weren't wealthy, but this chronicle of their adventures (and the occasional misadventure, such as the armored-car robbery that netted $50 million worth of cancelled checks) gives us more excitement than a whole fistful of novels. According to the authors, Cresta was one of the great unknown criminals, a man responsible for many crimes that remain unsolved to this day. Even though he was a "bad guy," it's awfully hard not to like him. Put this at the top of every true-crime fan's reading list. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

For me, the Justice League had become too much of a tight knit unit. Their relationships became nearly interchangeable, and in a team dynamic that is extremely dull. What conflicts would come out of their different personalities and approaches to these larger-than-life problems? How would the world's greatest super heroes really form a team? Their relationships are vastly different with one another and will continue to be.</p> <p> <strong>Jim Lee:</strong> It's been incredible to see so many people coming together and be a part of this fresh, new direction to move our characters forward for, what we hope, will be a new generation of fans. These are characters that have been around for many, many decades and you shouldn't feel scared to be changing that up because otherwise they're just going to ossify and become relics of the past, as opposed to something living and breathing in the present.</p> <p> <strong>Q: How are you balancing making these stories and characters feel fresh and new while still respecting what came before?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> You always want to remain true to the core essentials of the characters that have made them connect with generation after generation, but at the same time you want to take chances. You want to do something that hasn't been done. For me personally, I want to explore mythologies and villains and new elements that are introduced alongside the world's famous characters.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What would you say defines the character you are working on?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Their central concept, which is an emotionally driven one. I'm surprised by how many super heroes seem to lack believable motivation and, in comics, are often ill-defined. What does the character want? And how does that relate to the bigger story at hand? And how can I connect to that? That's what defines the character for me. Their powers, worlds and enemies should all be an extension of that.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What stories or creators inspire you most when working on your character?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> I'm inspired by anything that I connect to emotionally and, in the case of super heroes, that I cheer for.</p> <p> <strong>Q: So what do you consider to be your character's definitive stories?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> That's up to the audience to decide. Sinestro Corps became one because it connected with so many readers.</p> <p> <strong>Q: With over 75 years of stories, is it difficult discovering new ideas and places for these characters to go that haven't already been done?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> Surprisingly, there's always more stories to come from these characters--that's what makes them great.</p> <p> <strong>Q: What would you say is the difference in approach between writing and dialoguing the characters of <em>The New 52</em> versus their previous incarnations?</strong></p> <p> <strong>GJ:</strong> I don't want anything to be taken for granted. I don't want the Justice League to be the worked-together-and-friends-for-life characters that they've been. So approaching them in a different way, as people first and heroes second, is what I've been doing.</p> <strong>Q: Jim, what's it like working together with Geoff on Justice League? What about his writing do you think compliments your art?</strong><br> <br> <strong>JL:</strong> Geoff's energy jumps off the script and while he's known for his in-depth history of the rich DC Universe, it's his focus on character and the interpersonal quirks that really make it fun working on DC's trademark superteam. I get a big kick out of drawing their first interactions and more human aspects on the page, including a sense of humor and fun amidst this amazing roller-coaster ride of explosions, derring-do and heroics. At the end of the day, it's this journey you didn't expect that keeps people excited about comics!<br> <br> <strong>Q: Jim, you've been involved with two of the biggest comic launches in comics history, <em>X-Men No. 1</em> and <em>Justice League No. 1</em>. What's it like for you making such huge marks in the industry? Are they similar in any way?</strong><br> <br> <strong>JL:</strong> It's great! I think any artist wants to reach the widest audience possible for their work, so it's always gratifying to work on a project that captures a lot of fan attention and be considered a huge success. That instant feedback online and meeting fans at conventions is always a rush that fuels me to keep drawing late into the night. Justice League was part of a much larger effort, so it's even more rewarding to see the whole relaunch resonate with fans in a huge way!Geoff Johns is Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment.

The setting couldn&#x2019;t have been much more primitive: a one-room sixteen-by-eighteen-foot cabin by Sinking Spring, near Hodgenville, Kentucky. The cabin had but one window and one door (swinging on leather hinges), and the floor was dirt.<br> <br>Preposterous to even imagine that this little baby would grow up to live in the White House and become the most famous president of them&nbsp;all.<br> <br>Life expectancy was ever so short in that world. Doctors tended to be few and relatively untrained. Medicine was still in its infancy. Most any disease could become fatal. Most men would go through three wives, given that untold millions of women died from childbirth complications (neither doctors nor midwives washed their hands between patients, thus carrying puerperal fever with them).<br> <br>Few people on the frontier could read or write. Abe himself had only one year&#x2019;s schooling&#x2014;all the rest of his education would come from books, the most precious things in his life. Like most Americans of his time, it was enough to be knowledgeable about the Bible, Pilgrim&#x2019;s Progress, and Aesop&#x2019;s Fables. Unlike most of his peers, Abe was a voracious reader of what few books he could borrow or work for.<br> <br>Thomas Lincoln valued education not at all, and discouraged his son from reading or further education. Had it not been for the intervention of Abe&#x2019;s stepmother, Sarah Bush Johnston, Abe might well have failed to rise above the station of his rather indolent father.

He also traces her return to Europe in 1889 to care for her sick brother, philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and her orchestration of his rise to fame.</p><p>Ben Macintyre is a columnist and Associate Editor on The Times. He has worked as the newspaper's correspondent in New York, Paris and Washington. He is the author of nine books including Agent Zigzag, shortlisted for the Costa Biography Award and the Galaxy British Book Award for Biography of the Year 2008, the number 1 bestseller Operation Mincemeat and, most recently, the Richard &amp; Judy Book Club selection, Double Cross. He lives in London with his wife and three children.A mad curiosity carries an apparently sane young man to a lost German colony in Paraguay. In the picaresque romp that ensues, Macintyre, former foreign correspondent for Britain's Sunday Correspondent, discovers a forgotten people, exonerates Friedrich Nietzsche, and manages to piece together a rather chilling portrait of the troubled philosopher's far more dreadful sister. Not that Elisabeth Nietzsche was all that obscure to begin with: As editor and executrix of her brother's works, she was responsible for misshaping an entire generation of Nietzsche scholarship through a series of blatant misreadings aimed at serving the Nazi cause. A thoroughgoing racist and anti-Semite, she became convinced early on that the purity of the German nation was under siege, and, with her husband Bernard F&#x201d;rster, concocted the idea of an elite German settlement abroad that would eventually replenish and invigorate the downtrodden Aryan blood at home. Paraguay--of all places--was chosen as the most propitious site, and a small band of pioneers set sail in 1886 for what shortly became an unmitigated disaster. The land turned out to be untillable; the climate was deadly; and the finances were mismanaged from the start. Within a few years, F&#x201d;rster killed himself, and Elisabeth returned to Germany to care for her brother (who had lapsed into his final madness). Incredibly enough, the colony managed to survive precariously on its own and maintains itself to this day as a surreal Bismarckian outpost in the Paraguayan jungle. Macintyre weaves together several stories here- -Nietzsche's stormy relations with Wagner; Elisabeth's influence on the Nazis; the fate of the colonists left behind--without weakening the central narrative of his own journey to Nueva Germania and its gente perdita, a journey that was both the impetus and agent for this weird and marvelous tale.

We know the story of Noah, moved by divine vision to launch their escape. Now, in a work of astounding invention, acclaimed writer Sarah Blake reclaims the story of his wife, Naamah, the matriarch who kept them alive. Here is the woman torn between faith and fury, lending her strength to her sons and their wives, caring for an unruly menagerie of restless creatures, silently mourning the lover she left behind. Here is the woman escaping into the unreceded waters, where a seductive angel tempts her to join a strange and haunted world. Here is the woman tormented by dreams and questions of her own--questions of service and self-determination, of history and memory, of the kindness or cruelty of fate. <br><br>In fresh and modern language, Blake revisits the story of the Ark that rescued life on earth, and rediscovers the agonizing burdens endured by the woman at the heart of the story. <i>Naamah </i>is a parable for our time: a provocative fable of body, spirit, and resilience.</p><p><b>Sarah Blake</b> is the recipient of a Literature Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts. Her writing has appeared in <i>The Kenyon Review</i>, <i>The Threepenny Review</i>, <i>Slice</i>, and elsewhere.<p>one<br><br>Naamah is watching the horizon, hoping something will interrupt it and distract her, pull her eye to it, a moment of focus. She is humbled by the flood, but how long can someone reasonably be asked to experience humility?<br>She hears Noah's steps behind her and turns to him. "You scared me," she says.<br>"Sorry. I came to find you."<br>If she positioned Noah just right, along the railing, if she backed away from him, maybe his dark body would be tall enough to break the horizon. "I don't feel well," she says.<br>"Sick?" He puts his arms around her waist.<br>There are chickens and other animals wandering the deck. She can hear them, but she can't see them.<br>"No," she says. "Tired."<br>"Go tend to an animal."<br>She sways her body in a loose no.<br>"Let one nuzzle into your hand."<br>He's right. That used to cheer her up. "I can't see them anymore," she admits.<br>"You can't see them?" He comes around beside her, looks at her.<br>"No," she says. She states it so plainly she surprises herself.<br>The chickens are around their feet now, knowing Noah often has grain in his pocket. She feels one brush her leg and her body jumps; she hadn't realized how close they were. She doesn't know why she can't see them, but she's almost happy to be free of them, in this one way.<br>"Maybe you'll be able to see them again tomorrow," Noah says.<br>But that makes her feel worse. She squeezes her eyes shut.<br>Noah puts his hand on hers. "Come to bed, won't you?"<br>"It smells down there," she says.<br>"Then we'll sleep up here tonight. I'll get blankets."<br>"Okay," she agrees, and he is already off with purpose in his quick step.<br>Sleeping on the deck is cold, even under the blankets and folded into Noah, against his large, flat stomach. She remembers nights in the desert, in the tent, sleeping in this same position, but warm. They started so near to home; now, she can�t say where they are. She thinks that air must get cooler as it crosses the water. She thinks of the air traveling with such freedom across the earth, and she falls asleep.<br>Her oldest son, Japheth, often stands with her, looking out over the water. He�s not much taller than she is. She doesn�t have to raise her head to look him in the eye when he speaks. He tries to keep conversation light, tries to keep her happy, as if her unease depends on whether he can make her laugh. But sometimes he lets her lead the conversation where she�d like.<br>"Do you think about how many animals died?" she asks.<br>"Yeah."<br>"Do you think about how many people died?"<br>"Yeah, Mom."<br>"Do you think about the little things? Like what clothes they were wearing?"<br>"No."<br>"Only the big things."<br>"Yeah."<br>"Like how terrible it would be to drown?"<br>"Yeah."<br>She turns even further to the water. "It's all I can think about." She opens her shoulders to the floodwaters, which she wants to call the sea. "When do you think it will go down?"<br>"Soon. I have to think it's soon."<br>"Yes," Naamah says.<br>Her first labor, with Japheth, had been the most difficult. She had cramps through the night, then the mucus fell out, bloody and thick, then the pain, then the water, then, eventually, Japheth. They saw his head so many times, with each push, before she could get him out. But she did. And then her next sons came easily, as if Japheth had broken something that never needed to be set right again.<br>When Japheth was a teenager, he noticed that one of his teeth still had a ragged top, as all his teeth had when they first tore through his gums. He ran his fingernail over it again and again. It made a small click only he could hear. He asked Naamah if it would ever flatten, but she didn't know.<br>As soon as she birthed him, she knew that his body would be the most unpredictable thing in her life. It should have been obvious. Noah's body was not hers. No one's body was hers but her own. But after growing Japheth, after seeing the shape of his head through her skin, she felt deeply that his body was hers. And that feeling never passed. Later, as she had her other sons, the feeling grew less distinct and gave the illusion of passing, but then something would happen-say, a skin tag growing at an alarming rate near the crease of his elbow-and she would feel it again. How he belonged to her. And how separate they were.<br>She also began to feel separate from her own body. During that first labor, she had developed a hemorrhoid, which she didn't notice until weeks later, when it was no longer filled with blood, just a fold of skin that refused to retreat. If she gathered it up and pushed it down, it felt like a soft, round button. Otherwise it sagged. Her body made less and less sense to her as it seemed to reject itself.<br>But she loved to think of that first labor, holding on to that memory more vividly than others, than normal, happy times, eating dinner, playing games with the boys, telling them stories. She wanted to remember those times, but what could she do? Now she revisits her body in full contraction, covered in sweat. She can see the color of the sand beside her. She can feel the desert air rush through the tent, opened in the back and front, to cool her. She can no longer smell it, but the rest is enough.<br>Naamah lays out lunch on a blanket on the deck. Bowls of hummus, flatbread, dried figs, water to pass around. Noah and Japheth come to the deck first, followed by the younger sons, Shem and Ham, and then each of her sons' wives, as if they�d been speaking somewhere, privately.<br>"Good morning," Noah says, beaming at his children.<br>They all say their good mornings, first to Noah and then to each other, nodding little nods, smiling, sitting down in spots that have become theirs in the weeks since the rains stopped.<br>They eat quietly. They seem to pause to smell the wind off the sea, but it is not the sea; the smell is not salty but cool and crisp and not unpleasant.<br>Shem shoos away two goats that Naamah cannot see. Ham's wife, Neela, tosses a bit of bread in their direction. Naamah watches the bread land, then watches it disappear. She can picture the animal so clearly: its bent neck, its lips and teeth. She doesn't need to see it.<br>"Don't do that," Naamah says.<br>Neela looks embarrassed until Ham places his hand on her hand, and Neela remembers she doesn't need to mind Naamah.<br>For forty days and forty nights, they had to stay below deck. One time, Naamah undressed and snuck up. The rain hurt her skin as it fell on her, as she watched it beat the deck and then rush off the sides through the bars of the railing. The boat rocked, but not enough to worry her, just enough to let the water show how it could move together, just enough that one could imagine how waves form.<br>When she couldn't take it any longer, she returned to her room with Noah, her brown skin beaten pink. Noah rushed to her with a blanket and held her, dried her, warmed her, and she hid how much it hurt her, to be held then. The next day it was easy enough to avoid anyone's touch. And the day after that her skin had calmed.<br>She had wanted to try going out again, to test the feeling, but she was overwhelmed by her new understanding of the deaths of the people God no longer wanted.<br>Now, after lunch, Naamah sits on the deck with a mallet and chisel, some rope, and a piece of wood, slightly longer than the width of her. She hammers holes into the wood and threads the rope through. Once the rope is in place, running along the underside of the wood and splaying out of the other side like two tentacles, she sits down on the wood and pulls the ends of the rope up around herself.<br>She raises her arms above her head, trying to imagine the safest way to position the rope if she were deadweight. She lets herself slowly feel out the differences in the rope, higher and lower, with her head hung and with it raised. The rope is rough and reminds her of a braid of hair.<br>When everything feels right, she readjusts the lengths of rope on either side of her and ties a square knot, securing it. She tests it again, her hands above her, her head leaning into the softness of her own upper arm.<br>She's so near to completing the swing that she fills with excitement. She has been building it in her mind for days and has to remind herself not to rush now.<br>Finally, she adds another rope to the end of her first with a sheet bend knot. She uses two half hitches to tie it to the railing by the stairs. In her eagerness, she pulls on it harder than necessary, to make sure it holds. Her hands are burned. Where they were already chapped, they bleed.<br>Blood marks the wood of the seat when she grabs it and throws it over the side. She closes her eyes to listen, to hear if the rope is long enough to reach the water. It is. She hears it splash. She takes a few deep breaths, reveling in this small glory. Then she pulls the seat back up, leaves it to mark the deck a shade darker with its wetness, for as long as the sun will allow.<br>When the boys were young, they would walk quite far to the river for water. The boys would get their feet wet in the shallows and run away from the muddy bank, as fast as they could, hoping their feet would stay wet long enough to make footprints when they reached the sand. Shem�s small feet were somehow always dry when he got there; Ham left only heel prints because he�d run on tiptoe through the softer dirt. Japheth teased them both.<br>Naamah caught Shem looking at the bottoms of his feet as if something were wrong with them. She took off her shirt, wet it in the river, and laid it down. Ham immediately stepped on the shirt and made a detailed footprint, but Shem looked at her for permission. She nodded him on. He jumped on the shirt and then jumped away, leaving two perfect little feet staring back at them in the sand.<br>Naamah runs through the lower deck, calling for Noah. She passes the wives in a room, laughing about something. Sometimes they bring a small animal into a room, say a chinchilla, and laugh at its behaviors, sharing the story with the family later over dinner, cooing, How adorable. Naamah has no time for them.<br>"Noah!"<br>She passes more doors. By now, even though she can't see the animals, she knows where each of them rests. They used to make a lot more noise than they do now, and while she is glad for the relief, she worries they've grown accustomed to the boat. That makes her feel sick.<br>"Noah!"<br>Noah comes around a corner with a concerned look on his face; she's going so quickly that she runs into him. She laughs, and that catches him off guard and puts him at ease at the same time.<br>"What is it?" he says.<br>"Come with me." She would grab his hand but the halls are too narrow for that. She leads him to the deck, where the swing is. She undresses quickly. He smiles but doesn't understand until it's too late, until he sees her jump over the side of the boat.<br>"Naamah!" he shouts after her, and he immediately starts undressing, his eyes fixed on the water. His shirt is off when she resurfaces, spitting and splashing.<br>"Are you okay?" he shouts.<br>"Yes!" she yells back. She looks up and she's smiling. "When I'm done swimming, throw down the swing!"<br>"Are you done now?" Even yelling, she can hear the worry mixed into the joke.<br>"No! No, let me enjoy this!"<br>"It's not too cold?"<br>"I'm fine!"<br>She starts to follow the length of the boat, swimming on her side, but the boat is too long. Her breath tires first. Then her arms. She has to stop and float on her back, but this view of the sky is different, obscured by the boat, shaded but still lit, blue.<br>When she no longer wanted to go out in the flood's rain, she'd still come to the trapdoor that led to the deck and listen to it falling on the boat.<br>She had heard stories of light rains, of rains that pitter-pattered, that sprang lightly, but she was used to desert rains that came on fast and left everything drenched. She thought the flood rains would be like that, too. But they weren't. Their sound was horrible and flat in its constancy.<br>If she had to describe it, she would recall how each of her sons had, at some point, discovered that if they peed on a rock, the pee would splash. They would pee as hard as they could, aiming at an ant or a leaf, until their legs were covered in a spray of their own pee.<br>The rain reminded her of that, except that the rain came in a million streams. Which made her imagine God as a being with a million penises. Which terrified her. But she feared that He would see her terror and punish her for it, so she tried to feel love, instead, for the many-penised creature inside her head.<br>She hears the swing slapping the side of the boat.<br>"Naamah, come back up! Please!"<br>Naamah swims over to the swing, grabs the rope, pulls herself up, swings her legs through, and seats herself on the wood. She positions herself exactly as she'd planned, but it feels different this way, her legs hanging heavy over the wood.<br>"Ready," she calls up to him.<br>As he starts to pull, she uses the balls of her feet to bounce up the boat. Otherwise her body would be scraped against it. The boat would lick her coarse.<br>When Noah and Naamah had gone looking for a place in the desert to build the ark, they found a trove of cypress trees that God had made for them. They cut down one and fashioned a giant tub and a small bucket. They collected sap in the small bucket, from every tree, and gathered it all in the tub. Then they began to cut down the small forest.</p></p><h2>Canto General (Spanish Language Edition)</h2><p>A compilation of some of Neruda&#39;s most important poetry captures his different styles and pays tribute to those who influenced him during his life.</p><p><b>Pablo Neruda</b> (1904-1973) was born and died in Chile, but as a member of the diplomatic corps and later as a sort of roving cultural ambassador, he lived in and visited many parts of the world.

For the 2.2 million Albanians living in Kosovo, this sparked the abandonment of a nonviolent independence movement in favor of armed struggle. The tinderbox Balkan province of Kosovo thus remains in limbo as Albanians urgently rally their forces against Serbian rule.</p> <p>Exemplifying once again the best of narrative, analytical history, Noel Malcolm here provides the definitive story of Kosovo, from its origins to its current state of unrest. <b>Kosovo</b> clarifies the troubled past and present of this crucial region in a readable and neatly compressed style.</p></p><p>Kosovo, a 55-mile-long plateau in southern Serbia bordering Albania and Macedonia, should by all rights be a historical and political backwater. A Bulgarian geographer who visited Kosovo during World War I remarked that it was "almost as unknown and inaccessible as a stretch of land in Central Africa." The observation would prove ironically fitting by the '90s, as Central Africa and Kosovo both became sites of widespread genocide, fueled by ethnic hatreds, of the deepest international significance. Noel Malcolm, a British historian and journalist who has written extensively about the Balkans (including a companion volume of sorts on Bosnia), provides an overview of Kosovo's long-standing cultural divisions in his "short history" (although, at more than 500 pages, a not so short book). <p> Readers following the unfolding war in Kosovo through newspaper and television coverage may well ask why ethnic Albanians and Serbs are struggling so violently to command the small region. Kosovo, Malcolm explains, is the birthplace of Serbian nationalism; the defeat of Serbian forces there in 1389 by Turkish troops became emblematic of the fall of the Serbian empire, as it led to Turkish domination of the Balkans. Contemporary warriors of Serbia are, in Malcolm's eyes, evidently attempting to reverse the course of history by reclaiming the land from its Turkish conquerors--but in the absence of the Turks, they'll take it from the Albanians (the largest ethnic group among Kosovo's inhabitants) whose ancestors converted to Islam when the Turks ruled the region. Malcolm's lucid text shows again and again that the ethnic conflict in Kosovo is less a battle over bloodlines and religion than it is one over differing conceptions of national origins and history. "When ordinary Serbs learn to think more rationally and humanely about Kosovo, and more critically about some of their national myths," he concludes, "all the people of Kosovo and Serbia will benefit--not least the Serbs themselves." <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p><b>NOEL MALCOLM</b>, author of the widely acclaimed <b>Bosnia: A Short History </b>(also available from NYU Press), has been described by <i>The New York Times</i> as "President Clinton's favorite Balkans expert."</p></p><h2>Battletech 10: Main Event</h2><p>Eager to strike back at the Clans who destroyed his &#39;Mech and his career, former Com Guard soldier Jeremiah Rose recruits other soldiers from the arenas to create a new mercenary unit.

His source materials are the U.S. government's record of the trials of the Nazi criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunal and the transcripts of the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem. Except for the twelve part titles, none of the words here are Reznikoff's own: instead he has created, through selection, arrangement, and the rhythms of the testimony set as verse on the page, a poem of witness by the perpetrators and the survivors of the Holocaust themselves. He lets the terrible history unfold -- in history's own words. </p><p>Reznikoff's technique, says David Lehman, "contradicts the very faculty of understanding. He lets reality speak for itself, lets it state the externals of the thing or event, and leaves unspoken (or edits out) the emotions, which the reader may be counted on to provide for himself." </p><p>Few readers will forget the emotions they bring to <i>Holocaust.</i></p></p><p>The son of Russian garment workers, Charles Reznikoff (1894&#x2013;1976) was a blood-and-bone New Yorker, a collector of images and stories who walked the city from Bronx to Battery and breathed the soul of the Jewish immigrant experience into a lifetime of poetry.No other American work of poetry has found a form to adequately acknowledge that which is beyond adequate acknowledgment. -- <i>Charles Bernstein</i></p><h2>The Snow Queen: A Pop-Up Adaption of a Classic Fairytale</h2><p>This new holiday book features amazing paper engineering and pop-ups from the same paper engineer that developed the best-selling <i>Snowflakes </i>title.

They included Lord Byron, John Keats, and Mary Shelley, as well as a host of fascinating lesser-known figures: Mary Shelley&#x2019;s stepsister and Byron&#x2019;s mistress, Claire Clairmont; Hunt&#x2019;s botanist sister-in-law, Elizabeth Kent; the musician Vincent Novello; the painters Benjamin Haydon and Joseph Severn; and writers such as Charles and Mary Lamb, Thomas Love Peacock, and William Hazlitt. They were characterized by talent, idealism, and youthful ardor, and these qualities shaped and informed their politically oppositional stances&#x2014;as did their chaotic family arrangements, which often left the young women, despite their talents, facing the consequences of the men&#x2019;s philosophies.<br><br>In <i>Young Romantics</i>, Daisy Hay follows the group&#x2019;s exploits, from its inception in Hunt&#x2019;s prison cell in 1813 to its disintegration after Shelley&#x2019;s premature death in 1822.

Paul B. Janeczko's thoughtful, clearly organized guide provides a terrific starting point for anyone who has ever dreamed of putting pen to paper to express a thought or feeling. Janeczko covers a range of techniques to help young poets create magic with words. In chapters titled "Getting Ready," "Starting to Write," "Writing Poems that Rhyme," "Writing Free Verse Poems," and "When Your Poem Is Finished," readers will pick up tips on keeping journals, paying attention to "sound effects," revising, understanding figurative language, and submitting poems to publishers. They'll also learn to avoid such pitfalls as assuming you'll remember a brilliant idea (write it down!), not getting hung up on neatness or spelling, and keeping in mind that lots of people try to get published--not everyone will be. Special features include writing exercises, tips from poets, and bibliographical information. There's also a checklist of good poetry books and a glossary. Janeczko's enthusiasm and skill is reflected in this enjoyable, straightforward guide. As he says, "It's all done with words. No high-tech special effects. No computer-enhanced remastered sound. No trick photography. Words. Those things we've used since we were babies. And when you sit down to write a poem, you have the power of the words at your fingertips."

Finally, writers are encouraged to move on to more advanced forms of free verse . . . Interspersed throughout the text are tips from well-known poets, numerous examples, and writing exercises.

Tom joined Shackleton&#39;s Endurance expedition as the first shots of World War 1 were fired. In a most extraordinary feat of survival, Crean sailed the violent Southern Ocean in an open boat and made the first crossing of the glaciers of South Georgia to rescue his stranded comrades 800 miles away.

Rodriguez, Jr., served the United States for twenty-five years as an undercover officer before bringing his wealth of field knowledge to the CIA&#x2019;s Counterterrorism Center; now, in this riveting account and fascinating life story, one of America&#x2019;s top undercover operatives reveals how hard measures have derailed terrorist activity targeting the U.S., and saved countless American lives. Fully disclosed here for the first time are the undercover operations and tactics implemented during the George W. Bush presidency&#x2014;which were approved by the highest levels of the U.S. government, certified as legal by the Department of Justice, and supported by bipartisan leadership of congressional intelligence oversight committees. <br><br>But as the shock of 9/11 faded, the support that the intelligence community enjoyed and deserved gave way to shortsighted and potentially dangerous political correctness. One by one, the tools needed to successfully fight terrorism were banished, and the men and women who volunteered to carry out our nation&#x2019;s orders in combating al-Qa'ida found themselves second-guessed, hamstrung, and investigated&#x2014; including Rodriguez himself. In effect, the United States has chosen to willfully and unilaterally disarm itself in the war on terror. In <i>Hard Measures</i>, Rodriguez convincingly argues for the techniques used, and uncompromisingly details when these techniques were necessary, why they worked, and how, ultimately, they contributed to the capture of the world&#x2019;s most-wanted terror operatives, including Usama bin Ladin. From law school student to CIA recruit to his role as America&#x2019;s top spy, Rodriguez&#x2019;s full story is one of utmost importance&#x2014;a rare, insider&#x2019;s look at an issue that demands attention. Above all, it&#x2019;s a reasoned, imperative, and fully informed case for hard measures, and an explosive and gripping account of the real war on terror&#x2014; where it&#x2019;s been and where it&#x2019;s headed. <br><br>*** <br><br><b>Terrorism has always been one of the toughest targets on which to collect intelligence. </b>The secrets you want to steal frequently don&#x2019;t reside in computer systems, which can be hacked, or safes, which can be broken into, but in the inner recesses of a handful of individuals&#x2019; minds. <br><br>The clich� about intelligence work is that it is like working on a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle but not having the box top to show you what the finished picture should look like. If only it were that easy. In fact, it is more like working on a million-piece puzzle with no box top, and having millions more random pieces that look like they might fit, but actually are from different puzzles altogether. <br><br>It fell to us to make sense of the countless fragments of information and to take action on the chunks of the puzzle, which represented a real and growing threat to the United States and our allies. <br><br>&#x2014;from <i>Hard Measures</i></p><p><b>Jose A.

There were several parts to the structure, one for his living quarters, another section that appeared to be an office, and a third area where the general met visitors like me. He was casually dressed but all business. After subordinates served fruit juice and tea, Kayani let me know what was on his mind.<br> <br>A casual eavesdropper on my conversation with General Kayani might think, well, of course you would say yes to the general&#x2019;s request, and of course the U.S. and allied governments would applaud your action. But in the world of counterterrorism, nothing is straightforward.<br> <br>The loyalties of the ISI will probably always be suspect from an American perspective. While some senior officers like General Kayani proclaimed their support for our counterterrorism efforts, others a couple of echelons below him were happily supporting al-Qa&#x2019;ida and the Taliban, an organization that the ISI (with some U.S. help) had essentially created years earlier. How much ISI officers knew about Bin Ladin&#x2019;s whereabouts had always been hotly debated.<br> <br>I had come to Pakistan along with the CIA&#x2019;s director, General Mike Hayden, in part to try to nurture the tricky relationship between the Agency and the ISI. After several days of meetings, Hayden returned to the United States, but I stayed behind to probe the state of relations between our two organizations. My concern was more than bureaucratic. We were in the midst of a looming crisis, one in a series of tense moments that regularly marked our relations with the ISI. I had spent the day flying around on a Russian-built Pakistani MI-17 helicopter visiting Peshawar, the Khyber Pass, and remote tribal areas where the CIA and ISI tried to work together against terrorist targets.<br> <br>On my arrival back in Islamabad, CIA officers alerted me to some new intelligence that a terrorist cell in the U.K. that we and our British allies had been monitoring had selected specific transatlantic flights that they planned to bring down in an attack that would rival 9/11 in scale. <i>&#x201c;Co�o!&#x201d;</i> I said to myself. There had been many chilling intelligence reports over the past five years, but the more I learned, the more this seemed to me the most concrete and imminent threat to the U.S. since the World Trade Towers were brought down. The near-unanimous concern about a second attack that had galvanized our nation in the days, weeks, and months following 9/11 had since abated among politicians, the media, and the general public, but those of us on point in the fight knew that the threat had not gone away.<br> <br>In recent months, our British allies had learned of a U.K.-based terror cell and its plans to blow up as many as ten commercial airliners as they headed from Britain to New York, Washington, D.C., and California. Through excellent intelligence work, British intelligence and police officials had monitored plotters as they implemented an ingenious plan of draining soft drink bottles and replacing the contents with concentrated hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals, including the use of the powdered breakfast drink Tang as an explosive accelerant. The altered containers could easily pass through routine airport screenings that were in use at the time. Had they been detonated while all ten planes were at altitude over the Atlantic, there would have been a loss of life in the thousands. Evidence of exactly how the planes were brought down would have been lost at sea, and the panic in the international transportation arena would have been devastating.<br> <br>The effort British authorities devoted to tracking the plotters in their country was extraordinary. It was said to be the largest domestic surveillance effort ever conducted in the U.K. There seemed to be nineteen potential suicide bombers involved. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), that was the exact number of people who carried out the hijackings on September 11, 2001.<br> <br>The Brits originally learned of the plot by finding that one of the plotters had traveled from the U.K. to meet with a known al-Qa&#x2019;ida operative in Pakistan.<br> <br>The central figure in the plot was a man by the name of Rashid Rauf, a dual British/Pakistani national. The Brits knew a fair amount about him. Rauf was said to have been born in England of Pakistani parents and raised in the West Midlands city of Birmingham. He disappeared from the U.K. in 2002 in the middle of an investigation of the murder of his uncle. While never charged in that crime, he was definitely a &#x201c;person of interest&#x201d; to British authorities, not only for that matter, but also because of his known ties to violent Islamic militant groups in Pakistan. But they needed to know more about him.<br> <br>As troublesome as U.S. relations with Pakistan can be, our British allies can have an even more difficult time getting full cooperation from the ISI. Hard feelings dating back more than six decades to the Raj when Britain ruled the region meant that often the U.S. was able to get cooperation from the Pakistanis in ways that eluded the Brits.<br> <br>So the CIA took the lead in working with the ISI to try to track down Rauf and others in Pakistan who were behind the plot that was brewing in the U.K. Using our clandestine technical resources, we were able to determine that planning for the strike was coming from North Waziristan in the mountainous Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan.<br> <br>The CIA approached the ISI to see if they could shed additional light on the whereabouts and plans of Rashid Rauf. Although the plotters in the U.K. were under intense surveillance, at the time we did not know the whereabouts of Rauf. During his visit to Pakistan, General Hayden let senior Pakistani officials know that we were very interested in him.<br> <br>In my meeting with General Kayani a few days later I was told that the Pakistanis had learned that Rauf might soon be traveling from the tribal areas toward the city of Bahawalpur. General Kayani saw that there was a rare opportunity to roll up a terrorist and he asked me if the U.S. would support Rauf&#x2019;s immediate capture. I made an on-the-spot decision. &#x201c;Absolutely. We want this bad guy!&#x201d; It seemed to me that telling Kayani anything else would have undermined the relationship we were trying to build with the ISI. I made the call despite a vague understanding that British authorities were hoping we would not move too rashly against Rauf. They wanted time to follow the trail of the U.K.-based terrorists to see what other leads might develop and to generate more court-admissible evidence for a future trial. But to me, the news that the plotters had moved to the point of selecting actual flights to bring down meant that we could not afford to wait.<br> <br>When my meeting with General Kayani ended, I departed for a local hotel. Brigadier General Azmat Hayam Khan, one of Kayani&#x2019;s top subordinates and head of Pakistani counterterrorism, was supposed to host a dinner for me there as a way to build greater rapport with his senior officers. Such representational duties are among the more tedious of the chores of someone in my position, but necessary if you are hoping to maximize the support of your foreign counterparts.<br> <br>The general was in the front seat of an armored sedan. Security vehicles led and trailed us as we wove our way through the teeming streets of Islamabad and headed for the hotel. In the backseat, I was joined by the CIA&#x2019;s chief of station in the region, whose name I am not at liberty to divulge. Within minutes, Azmat&#x2019;s cell phone rang. I could hear him fire off a series of urgent questions in Urdu. He turned to my colleague and said, &#x201c;The plan, as General Kayani has said, is coming together. The terrorist Rauf is on a bus heading for one of our checkpoints. We want to proceed with his capture. Are you with us?&#x201d;<br> <br>My colleague turned to me. &#x201c;What do you think, boss?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get him,&#x201d; I said. The cautious thing would have been to consult with Washington. But doing so would have been the equivalent of saying &#x201c;no.&#x201d; Washington never responds instantly&#x2014;especially in a situation such as this where they would have wanted to have some meetings, develop position papers, do some contingency planning, and consult the British. But in my mind, this opportunity demanded an instant decision.<br> <br>Scrapping the plan for dinner, our two sides, the CIA and the ISI, set up command centers to listen to live feed from our forces in Bahawalpur providing a blow-by-blow account of the takedown of Rashid Rauf. The capture, carried out by Pakistani troops with CIA officers providing high-tech assistance nearby, was almost uneventful. If only I could say that about the aftermath.<br> <br>Once I was assured that Rauf was in Pakistani control, I called CIA headquarters in Virginia and told my chief of staff what had happened. I asked her to go down the hall and brief the deputy CIA director, Steve Kappes. She called back minutes later: &#x201c;Steve is livid. He wants to know why you let the Pakistanis conduct the takedown.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I agreed with them&#x201d; was my simple answer.<br> <br>She said that the Brits were insistent on following leads on this case a while longer to see who or what else might be implicated. &#x201c;President Bush apparently told Prime Minister Blair a few hours earlier that we would move slowly on this plot,&#x201d; she said. My unilateral decision apparently had caused a diplomatic incident. Because of it, they were scrambling to arrest all the known cell members in Britain that very night.<br> <br>I was sorry for any inconvenience to President Bush and Prime Minister Blair&#x2014;although no one had bothered to tell me about their conversation beforehand. But I am convinced that the decision to capture Rauf was the right one. If you are operating in a place like Great Britain you can confidently expect that Scotland Yard can track a criminal subject clandestinely for weeks on end. But in a country like Pakistan, if a chance suddenly presents itself to capture someone known to be in the final stage of planning multiple, simultaneous terrorist attacks, you better take them down. You act immediately because the opportunity may not come again&#x2014;and you may not get another chance before attacks are launched. If, in the wake of a second successful terrorist attack of 9/11 proportions, it were to be revealed that the head of the U.S. clandestine service passed up a chance to capture one of the plot&#x2019;s masterminds, the second-guessers outside, and especially inside, government would have been merciless, and rightly so.<br><br>As it turned out, the Brits were able to swiftly arrest twenty-five suspects. They eventually brought to trial seventeen on charges of plotting to commit murder. Three received life sentences. While the trials themselves may not be memorable to most Americans, the impact of the case behind them certainly is. It is because of this group that since 2006 you are unable to fly with more than three ounces of liquids in your carry-on luggage. Rauf&#x2019;s plotters&#x2019; plan to mix commonly available chemicals in soda bottles would easily have killed thousands of innocent people in transatlantic flight.<br> <br>The Pakistanis held Rauf in custody while the Brits rolled up the terror cells in England. Since Pakistan does not have an extradition treaty with the U.K., they refused to hand him over to the Brits and insisted that any questions we or the British had for Rauf be funneled through the ISI. Happy as we were to have Rauf off the streets, he was not under our control.<br> <br>Three months after his capture, Pakistan moved to drop the terrorism charges against Rauf, allegedly for lack of evidence. They continued to hold him on explosives and false-identity counts, but in late 2007 he mysteriously &#x201c;escaped&#x201d; from Pakistani custody. He had been held at the high-security Adiala prison when his guards reportedly decided to allow him to go to a local mosque for prayers. Not surprisingly, Rauf did not return. Given the uncertain loyalties of some inside the Pakistani security system, it is foolish to take for granted our ability to follow, detain, or interrogate terrorists using Pakistani surrogates.<br> <br>Two years later, it was reported in the media that Rauf was killed in a U.S. drone strike. His supporters deny this fact to this day.<br> <br>In the immediate aftermath of the arrest of the plotters in the U.K. there was a lot of finger-pointing. Unnamed British sources told the media that the U.S. had overreacted and brought down Rauf prematurely. My relations with British intelligence took a decidedly chilly turn. A bogus theory from American writer Ron Suskind received great play in the media, suggesting that President Bush and Vice President Cheney had ordered the arrest of Rauf and the establishment of the draconian &#x201c;no liquids on planes&#x201d; rules to somehow influence the upcoming U.S. midterm elections. This was a patently ludicrous assertion.<br> <br>And in general, the media widely denigrated the takedown of the terror cell in the U.K., saying that some of the British plotters had not yet gotten passports or plane tickets and therefore there was no urgency, as if stopping a terrorist attack doesn&#x2019;t count unless the burning fuse is snuffed out seconds before an explosion. The pundits forget that if we had been so fortunate as to interdict any of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers months before the attacks they might have been dismissed as a laughable bunch of losers who didn&#x2019;t inspire fear or confidence.<br> <br>The liquids plot saga turned out to be emblematic of my CIA career. If there was a common thread during my lengthy time at the Agency, it was that no good deed went unpunished. The liquid plot incident further drove home to me the importance of swift action, of nimble decision making, and of being able to hold and interrogate key terrorist suspects ourselves without relying on surrogates who have a different and uncertain agenda.<br> <br>Throughout my career, controversy followed me around like a hungry dog. I wish all my decisions and all my actions were universally supported and applauded. But I am comfortable with who I am and what I have done.<br> <br>I have been extraordinarily privileged to play a role in some historic events and believe I am uniquely positioned to explode some myths and clarify some mysteries that have heretofore gone unexplained.<br> <br>As memories of 9/11 faded, political correctness and timidity grew. The unanimity of support that the intelligence community enjoyed eroded, and one by one the tools needed to fight those who wish to destroy our country have been taken away. Worse, those men and women who volunteered to carry out our n...</p><h2>Classical Mechanics [Paperback] [Jan 01, 2001] H.

He showed them how to plant corn, beans, and squash, and how to hunt and fish. And when a good harvest was gathered in the fall, the two peoples feasted together in the spirit of peace and brotherhood.<br> Almost four hundred years later, the tradition continues. . . .<br></p><p>Most American children know the story of the Pilgrims and the first Thanksgiving, but the Native American side of the tale is far less familiar. Joseph Bruchac, a prolific and award-winning author of Native American descent (<i>The First Strawberries</i>, <i>A Boy Called Slow</i>) describes life in 1620 for a man who was destined to save the Pilgrims even as he was losing his family and tribe. Told from Squanto's point of view, this historically accurate and detailed story brings to life one of the most important moments in America's past. Demonstrating how much his people (the Patuxet, the People of the Falls) value honor, Squanto befriends English traders, even after being kidnapped and taken to Spain. After much hard work, Squanto manages to sail back to his homeland, where, in spite of his discovery that many of his people have died from disease brought by white people, he acts as envoy between the English and his own people, and helps the pilgrims survive in their new world.<p> Throughout this moving tale, Squanto's belief that "these men can share our land as friends" poignantly shines through. Greg Shed's gouache illustrations capture the warmth and dignity of Squanto and his friends. Young readers will be fascinated by this lesser-known perspective on the Thanksgiving tradition that remains strong today.

Bordering the Mississippi, these antebellum landmarks were once the epitome of gracious living in the Deep South. Over the past century, these grand dwellings have slowly succumbed to time, humidity, and the reclamation of the land: first by nature, then by real-estate developers who built subdivisions, oil refineries, and strip malls where curtains of Spanish moss once swayed from the live oaks. This collection&#x2014;featuring over 200 haunting color photographs with extensive captions explaining the architectural significance and history of each structure&#x2014;is a beautiful elegy for a rapidly disappearing landscape and its ghosts.</p><p>Richard Sexton is a New Orleans-based photographer, writer, and lecturer.

He lives in the Boston area.In 1716 John Law, in what McCaffety calls a "real-estate scam," persuaded the Duc d'Orleans to sell shares for a French settlement. A flood wiped out the settlement in the first year, but the colonists continued to come. By the mid-19th century, New Orleans was the busiest port in the world, with a strange alchemy of European, Carbbean, and American influences in character and architecture that is totally unique. NPR's recent report on the damage done in Louisiana and particularly in New Orleans by the voracious Formosa termite makes viewing these two books of stylish photography even more poignant. Award-winning photographer McCaffety (Obituary Cocktail: The Great Saloons of New Orleans) lovingly records scenes of luxury and decay in the Vieux Carr or the French Quarter of New Orleans. McCaffety offers the reader views that elude the countless tourists. We are privy to private, antiques-filled residences, walled courtyards with balconies and fountains, lush tropical gardens--what she calls "the city's hidden memory." Sexton's work looks at "the River Road," a stretch of highway that links New Orleans to Baton Rouge. The National Trust for Historic Preservation has identified the area as one of the most endangered historic sites in the United States. Law's influence was shown here also, as he was given a charter to increase the French population to 10,000 in a ten-year period. Likewise, a distinctive architecture evolved here: the plantation on the river with a dominant main house. Much of the style is still around, and with aerial photographer Alex MacLean, Sexton captures the grandeur. We see standing chimneys from lost glorious homes, stately houses still active and enjoyed, and plantations of historical note. Sexton also shows other notable architecture and its geography--tenement "shotgun" houses, cemeteries, churches, steamboat landings, levees, swamp, sugarcane, and massive oaks hanging with Spanish Moss are occasionally interspersed by abandoned oil refineries and massive new petro-chemical operations. Both of these books are essential regional purchases, but they are also highly recommended for architecture, photography, and history collections everywhere.<br><i>-Joseph C.

You cannot stop your mind by an act of will any more than you can stop the beating of your own heart. Some cultures describe mind as a drunken monkey, reeling from place to place with no rhyme or reason. Like meditation/ knitting calms the monkey down....I believe that in the quiet/ repetitive, hypnotic rhythms of creating craft, the inner being may emerge in all its quiet beauty. The very rhythm, of the knitting needles can become as incantatory as a drumbeat or a Gregorian chant."</p><p>-- from <em>The knitting Sutra</em></p><p>Knitting as prayer? Craft as spiritual path? In this wonderfully allusive story of the quest to master a craft, Susan Gordon Lydon's love of knitting and her search for spiritual insight become powerfully and lyrically intertwined.</p><p>Lydon's journey begins when she knits a turquoise chenille sweater to help a broken bone in her arm "knit." In pursuit of a perfect silver button for her sweater -- and a medicine man for her arm -- she ends up on a Navajo reservation where a community of women live by the proceeds of their craft in a unified cycle of livelihood, art, and spirituality. They remind Lydon of the women on the Shetland Islands who developed classic knitting patterns and of the women who gather at her local yarn shop. From old-fashioned quilting bees to the hundreds of knitters who communicate on the Internet, she recognizes in craftspeople the confluence of self, community, creativity, ritual, and the urge to beautify the everyday.</p><p>Each new knitting project she begins and every new skill she masters bring her closer to serenity and insight that have sometimes eluded her through years of spiritual explorations. In one passage, her arm healed and her passion for knitting rekindled, Lydon finds herself selling old books and clothes to buy a particularly extravagant yarn. The red sweater it becomes represents the lessons in daring and self-trust she learns while crafting it. Even a bout with cancer ("I particularly didn't want to die because I wanted to finish my Alice Starmore sweater") and the hiatus from knitting a tendinitis diagnosis demands guide her to take the lessons she has learned from knitting -- sitting still, focusing the mind, asking for help -- and apply them to the rest of her life.</p><p>Dedicated to "all the women who knit too much," Lydon's rich insights will delight and inspire all who seek the extraordinary in the everyday.</p></p><p>Available for the first time in paperback, <i>The Knitting Sutra</i> reveals how women can learn to knit their way to nirvana.<br> <br>When Susan Gordon Lydon was coping with a broken arm, her craft took on new significance. While knitting was essential to strengthening her hands, it also provided her with a newfound sense of peace and creativity. Immersed in brilliant colors, textures, and images of beautiful sweaters, Lydon found healing and enlightenment in a way she had never imagined. Capturing this journey of discovery, <i>The Knitting Sutra</i> recounts her remarkable membership in a community of craftswomen around the world, from sweater makers in Scotland to Navajo weavers, and the adventures that her craft led her on. <p>As she masters new techniques and conquers old obstacles, Lydon's story conveys how the lessons she learned from knitting, such as stillness and interdependence, later sustained her through a cancer diagnosis and even the incapacitation of her hands. <i>The Knitting Sutra </i>is<i> </i>both a meditation on craft and an affirmation for anyone seeking heartfelt comfort.</p><p>"Gracefully links handcraft and spiritual practice in our everyday lives.

Chaos and Order. Light and dark. In the beginning &#x2014; or back in the day &#x2014; there was fire coming out of a hole in the ice, bringing disruption, turmoil, and change. Change isn&#x2019;t always comfortable, but it is a fact of life. And that&#x2019;s where life as we know it began, as the fires of World Below pierced the ice of World Above.<br> <br>Before that, there were no Middle Worlds. No gods, no Folk, no wildlife. There was only Order and Chaos then, pure and uncorrupted.<br> <br>But neither Order nor Chaos is very hospitable. Perfect Order is immovable &#x2014; frozen, unchanging, and sterile. Total Chaos is uncontrolled &#x2014; volatile and destructive. The middle ground &#x2014; basically, lukewarm water &#x2014; created the perfect environment for another kind of life to emerge among the frozen Wilderlands and volcanoes erupting under the ice.<br> <br>The Authorized Version goes like this, supported by the Oracle. From the meeting of Order and Chaos there came a giant being called Ymir, the father of the Ice Folk, and a cow, Audhumla, which licked at the salt that was in the ice and brought out the first man, Buri. From this I think we can all conclude that the cow was the primary instigator of everything that followed &#x2014; War, Tribulation, the End of the Worlds. Lesson One: Never trust a ruminant.<br> <br>Now the sons of Buri and those of Ymir hated each other from the start, and it didn&#x2019;t take long for them to go to war. Buri&#x2019;s three grandsons, the sons of B�r &#x2014; their names were Odin, Vili, and Ve &#x2014; finally killed old Ymir and made the Middle Worlds from what was left of him: the rocks from his bones, the earth from his flesh, the rivers from his steaming blood. His skull became the Firmament; his brains, the clouds; his eyebrows, the division between Inland and the Outlands.<br> <br>Of course, there&#x2019;s no way of proving this &#x2014; let&#x2019;s face it &#x2014; rather unlikely hypothesis. All of the possible witnesses have disappeared, except for Odin, the Old Man, the only survivor of that war, architect and chronicler of what we now call the Elder Age and, as it happens, the only one (except for me) to have heard the fateful prophecy, delivered to him by Mimir&#x2019;s Head when the Worlds were fresh and new.<br> <br>Call me cynical if you like. But it all sounds a bit too convenient. The Authorized Version of events leaves out a number of details, which Creationists seem content to ignore. I personally have my doubts &#x2014; not least about the giant cow &#x2014; although even now you have to beware of how you express these sentiments. At one time, even to suggest that Odin&#x2019;s account of things might have been metaphorical instead of literal would have resulted in cries of heresy and a good deal of personal discomfort for Yours Truly, which is why, even then, I was always careful to keep my scepticism to myself.<br> <br>But that&#x2019;s how religions and histories make their way into the world, not through battles and conquests, but through poems and kennings and songs, passed through generations and written down by scholars and scribes. And that&#x2019;s how, five hundred years later or so, a new religion with its new god came to supplant us &#x2014; not through war, but through books and stories and words.<br> <br>After all, words are what remain when all the deeds have been done. Words can shatter faith, start a war, change the course of history. A story can make your heart beat faster, topple walls, scale mountains &#x2014; Hey, a story can even raise the dead. And that&#x2019;s why the King of Stories ended up being King of the gods, because writing history and making history are only the breadth of a page apart.<br> <br>Not that there was much of that when Odin was fighting the Ice Folk. There were no runes to write with then, and nothing but rock to write upon. But metaphor or otherwise, this is as much as I believe: that the world came into being through Change, which is the servant of Chaos, and only through Change has it endured. Much like Your Humble Narrator, in fact, adapting to suit the circumstance.<br> <br>The snow hare changes its coat to white to go unseen in winter. The ash tree drops its leaves in the fall, better to survive the cold. All of life does the same &#x2014; even gods &#x2014; turning their coats to suit the turning seasons of the world. There should be a name for that kind of thing &#x2014; in fact, it should be one of my names. Let&#x2019;s call it Revolution.</p><h2>Why Did I Ever</h2><p>After a ten-year silence, Mary Robison has emerged with a novel so beguiling and funny that it has brought critics and her live-reading audiences to their feet. Why Did I Ever takes us along on the darkest of private journeys. The story, told by a woman named Money Breton, is submitted like a furious and persuasive diary-a tale as fierce and taut as its fictional teller.</p><p>Mary Robison was born in Washington, D.C. She graduated from Johns Hopkins, where she studied with John Barth. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, two Pushcart Prizes, an O. Henry Award, and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction. She is the author of three previous novels, Oh! (1981), Subtraction (1991), and Why Did I Ever (2001), and of four story collections, Days (1979), An Amateur&#x2019;s Guide to the Night (1983), Believe Them (1988), and Tell Me (2002). Robison has written for Hollywood and has been a contributor to The New Yorker since 1977. She lives in Gainesville, Florida.In her first novel in a decade, Robison, a writer with switchblade wit, unveils the helter-skelter consciousness of Money Breton. The cynical veteran of three marriages and the mother of two screwed-up adult children, Money, still a man-magnet, is a Hollywood script doctor who commutes from a small town somewhere outside New Orleans. When she isn't pretending to work, she holds surreal conversations with the Deaf Lady, trades insults with two persistent suitors, frets over her missing cat, and takes out her fear and anger on household objects. Money's gay son, Paulie, has been tortured and raped and is currently in police custody. Mev, Money's lawyer daughter, is struggling with a methadone habit. Crazy with worry and embroiled in the maddening revision of an idiotic script about Bigfoot, Money riffs with a caustic yet deadpan humor not unlike that of Lynda Barry on men, movies, traffic, airlines, and life in general in 572 terse, numbered, and jabbing paragraphs. Robison's incandescent soliloquy on the absurdity of existence hones fiction to a new and exhilarating measure of sharpness. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What united these men was that for all of them nature remained the inviolate, all-inclusive principle of explanation, precluding any appeal to a supernatural cause or ordering agency.<br> In a detailed analysis of the astronomical and physical theories of the Timaeus, Vlastos demonstrates Plato's role in the reception and transmission of the discovery of the new conception of the universe. Plato gives us the chance to see that movement from a unique perspective: that of a fierce opponent of the revolution who was determined to wrest from its brilliant discovery, annex its cosmos, and redesign it on the pattern of his own idealistic and theistic metaphysics.<br> This book is a reprint of the edition published in 1975 by the University of Washington Press.

Modeled after the &#x201c;cottages&#x201d; of Newport, Rhode Island, the spacious, elegant property, sitting on fourteen acres of lush Bel Air, fits its owner to a T. For the man behind the wheel of the Rolls is Hollywood&#x2019;s ageless wonder, Cooper Winslow. A star of the silver screen for decades, a man whose allure to women is the stuff of legend, Coop exudes grace, charm, and old-fashioned style. But today Coop Winslow is in for a major surprise. He&#x2019;s broke. And with no major roles coming his way, Coop is faced with the heartbreaking prospect of selling his beloved home of forty years, or at least renting out the gatehouse and part of the main house. A huge blow to Coop, whose debonair attitude allows him to escape reality much of the time. <br> <br>His new tenants, Mark Friedman and Jimmy O&#x2019;Connor, are busy coping with problems of their own. Mark&#x2019;s wife of sixteen years just walked out, and Jimmy recently lost his own wife to a devastating illness. But everything changes when Mark&#x2019;s teenage son and daughter move in. Suddenly, <b>The Cottage</b> is transformed, with music blasting from every corner, teenagers on skateboards crashing into vintage cars, and a never-ending parade of young starlets streaming in and out to visit Coop. <br><br>But amid all the noise and the chaos, something unexpected is happening. Three men who never would have met are becoming friends...and each man finds himself changing in surprising ways, Coop most of all. Because beneath the dazzle and flash, the impeccably tailored suits and the sheer bravado, is a man trying to keep control of his carefully ordered world&#x2013;a world that is becoming more and more unpredictable with each passing day. <br><br>First, a tabloid scandal erupts, threatening Coop&#x2019;s budding romance with a wealthy debutante. . .A stranger approaches Coop with stunning news....A devastating accident almost claims the life of one of the housemates....And in the midst of it all, <b>The Cottage</b> welcomes a new houseguest with a secret of her own, who will change Coop&#x2019;s life in unexpected ways. Because among the people who share his cottage and his life, Coop Winslow&#x2013;loner, bachelor, movie star&#x2013;may find the rarest of all opportunities: a chance to build a happiness he could never have dreamed of on his own, and to become the kind of human being he has never been. <br><br>Against a glittering backdrop of celebrity and glamour, Danielle Steel digs deeper to tell a story of friendship and love, tragedy and second chances...of the choices and unexpected turns of fate that can shape characters and lives.</p><p>Danielle Steel has been hailed as one of the world&#x2019;s most popular authors, with over 560 million copies of her novels sold. Her many international bestsellers include <b>Sisters</b>, <b>H.R.H.</b>, <b>Coming Out</b>, <b>The House</b>, <b>Toxic Bachelors</b>, <b>Miracle</b>, and other highly acclaimed novels. She is also the author of <b>His Bright Light</b>, the story of her son Nick Traina&#x2019;s life and death.<i>Chapter One</i><br>The sun glinted on the elegant mansard roof of <i>The Cottage </i>, as Abe Braunstein drove around the last bend in the seemingly endless driveway. The sight of the imposing French manor would have taken his breath away, if the driver had been anyone but Abe. It was a spectacular home, and he had been there dozens of times before. The Cottage was one of the last legendary homes of Hollywood. It was reminiscent of the palaces built by the Vanderbilts and Astors in Newport, Rhode Island, at the turn of the century. This one was in the style of an eighteenth century French chateau and was opulent, handsome, graceful, exquisite in every aspect of its design. <br><br>It had been built for Vera Harper, one of the great stars of silent movies, in 1918. She had been one of the few early stars to conserve her fortune, had married well more than once, and had lived there until she died at a ripe old age in 1959. Cooper Winslow had bought it from her estate a year later. She had had no children and no heirs, and had left everything she had, including The Cottage to the Catholic Church. He had paid a handsome sum for it even then, because his career had been booming at the time. His acquisition of The Cottage<i> </i>had caused a considerable stir. It had been quite an extraordinary house and property for a young man of twenty-eight, no matter how major a star he was. Coop had had no embarrassment about living in the palatial home, and was comfortable that it was worthy of him.<br><br>The house was surrounded by fourteen acres of park and impeccably manicured gardens in the heart of Bel Air; it had a tennis court, an enormous pool paved in blue and gold mosaic, and there were fountains located in a number of places on the grounds. The design of the grounds and gardens had allegedly been copied from Versailles. It was quite a place. Inside the house were high-vaulted ceilings, many of them painted by artists brought in from France to do the work. The dining room and library were wood-paneled, and the boiseries and floors in the living room had been brought over from a chateau in France. <br><br>It had provided a wonderful setting for Vera Harper, and had been a spectacular home for Cooper Winslow ever since. And the one thing Abe Braunstein was grateful for was that Cooper Winslow had bought it outright when he purchased it in 1960, although he had taken two mortgages out on it since. But even they didn't hamper its value. It was by far the most important piece of property in Bel Air. It would have been hard to put a price on it today. There were certainly no other houses comparable to it in the area, or anywhere else for that matter, except maybe in Newport, but the value of the estate in Bel Air was far greater than it would have been anywhere else, despite the fact that it was now somewhat in disrepair.<br><br>There were two gardeners pulling weeds around the main fountain as Abe got out of his car, and two others working in a flowerbed nearby, as Abe made a mental note to cut the gardening staff in half, at the very least. All he could see as he looked around him were numbers, and dollar bills flying out windows. He knew almost to the penny what it cost Winslow to run the place. It was an obscene amount by anyone's standards, and certainly by Abe's. He did the accounting for at least half the major stars in Hollywood, and had learned long since not to gasp or wince or faint or make overt gestures of outrage when he heard what they spent on houses and cars and furs and diamond necklaces for their girlfriends. But in comparison to Cooper Winslow, all of their extravagances paled. <br><br>Abe was convinced that Coop Winslow spent more than King Farouk. He'd been doing it for nearly fifty years, he spent money like water, and hadn't had an important part in a major movie in more than twenty years. For the last ten, he'd been reduced to minor character parts, and cameo appearances, for which he was paid very little. And for the most part, no matter what the movie or the role or the costume, Cooper always seemed to play the dashing, charming, fabulously handsome Casanova, and more recently the irresistible aging roue. <br><br>But no matter how irresistible he still was on screen, there were fewer and fewer parts for him to play. In fact, as Abe rang the front door bell and waited for someone to answer, Coop hadn't had any part at all in just over two years. But he claimed he met with directors and producers about their new movies every day. Abe had come to talk turkey with him about that, and about cutting back his expenses radically in the near future. He had been living in debt and on promises for the past five years. And Abe didn't care if he made commercials for his neighborhood butcher, but Coop was going to have to get out and work--and soon. There were a lot of changes he was going to have to make. He had to cut back dramatically, reduce his staff, sell some of his cars, stop buying clothes and staying at the most expensive hotels around the world. Either that, or sell the house, which Abe would have preferred.<br><br>He wore a dour expression as he stood in his gray summer suit, white shirt, and black and gray tie, as a butler in a morning coat opened the front door. He recognized the accountant immediately and nodded a silent greeting. Livermore knew from experience that whenever the accountant came to visit, it put his employer in a dreadful mood. It sometimes required an entire bottle of <i>Cristal</i> champagne to restore him to his usual good spirits, sometimes an entire tin of caviar too. He had put both on ice the moment Liz Sullivan, Coop's secretary, had warned Livermore that the accountant would be arriving at noon.<br><br>She had been waiting for Abe in the paneled library, and crossed the front hall with a smile as soon as she heard the bell. She had been there since ten that morning, going over some papers to prepare for the meeting, and she'd had a knot in her stomach since the night before. She had tried to warn Coop what the meeting was about, but he'd been too busy to listen the previous day. He was going to a black-tie party, and wanted to be sure to get a haircut, a massage, and a nap before he went out. And she hadn't seen him that morning. He was out at a breakfast at the Beverly Hills Hotel when she arrived, with a producer who had called him about a movie with a possible part in it for him. <br><br>It was hard to pin Coop down, particularly if it involved bad news or something unpleasant. He had an instinctive sense, a kind of finely tuned supersonic radar that warned him almost psychically about things he didn't want to hear. Like incoming Scud missiles, he managed to dodge them with ease. But she knew he had to listen this time, and he had promised to be back by noon. With Coop, that meant closer to two.<br><br>"Hello, Abe, it's nice to see you," Liz said warmly. She was wearing khaki slacks, a white sweater, and a string of pearls, none of which flattered her figure, which had expanded considerably in the twenty-two years she'd worked for Coop. But she had a lovely face, and naturally blonde hair. She had been truly beautiful when Coop hired her, she had looked like an advertisement for Breck shampoo.<br><br>It had been love at first sight between them, not literally, or at least not from Coop's side. He thought she was terrific, and valued her flawless efficiency, and the motherly way she had taken care of him from the first. When he hired her she had been thirty years old, and he was forty-eight. She had worshipped him, and had a secret crush on him for years. She had given her life's blood to the impeccable running of Cooper Winslow's life, working fourteen hours a day, sometimes seven days a week, if he needed her, and in the process, she had forgotten to get married or have kids. It was a sacrifice she had willingly made for him. She still thought he was worth it. And at times she was worried sick about him, particularly in recent years. <br><br>Reality was not important to Cooper Winslow. He considered it a minor inconvenience, like a mosquito buzzing around his head, and he avoided it all costs. Successfully, from his perspective at least, most of the time. Nearly always in fact. Coop only heard what he wanted to hear, i.e., only good news. The rest he filtered out long before it reached either his brain or his ears. And so far, he had gotten away with it. Abe had come that morning to deliver reality to him, whether Coop liked it or not.<br><br>"Hello, Liz. Is he here?" Abe asked, looking stern. He hated dealing with Coop. They were opposites in every way.<br><br>"Not yet," she said with a friendly smile, as she led him back to the library, where she'd been waiting for both of them. "But he'll be back any minute. He had a meeting about a lead part."<br><br>"In what? A cartoon?" Liz very diplomatically did not respond. She hated it when people said rude things about Coop. But she also knew how irritated the accountant had been with him.<br><br>Coop had followed absolutely none of his advice, and his precarious financial situation had become even more so, disastrously so in fact, in the past two years. And Abe's last words to Liz on the phone the day before had been "This has to stop." He had come on a Saturday morning to deliver the message, and it annoyed him no end that as usual, Coop was late. He always was. And because of who he was, and how endearing he could be when he chose to, people always waited for him. Even Abe.<br><br>"Would you like a drink?" Liz asked, playing hostess, as Livermore stood by stone-faced. He had a single expression he used in every situation, none. It seemed to suit his part. Although rumor had it that once or twice, when Cooper teased him mercilessly about something, he had actually smiled. But no one had actually seen him do it, so it was more legend than fact. But Coop swore he did.<br><br>"No, thanks," Abe said, looking almost equally expressionless as the butler, although Liz could see that irritation was creeping in at a rapid speed.<br><br>"Iced tea?" There was still...</p><h2>Jimmy&#39;s Boa and the Big Splash Birthday Bash</h2><p>Jimmy&#39;s birthday party at SeaLand turns out to be a big splash when everyone ends up in the big tank</p><p><b>Trinka Hakes Noble</b> is an award-winning author and illustrator who has published more than 30 children&#x2019;s books throughout her career.

It proved a sufficient provocation. After a long nap and a glance at the icy waters of the lake, the promising young man I imagined myself to be was quickly cut down by loneliness and boredom. I filled the pages of my journal not with the insights of a budding naturalist, philosopher, or mystic but with a list of the foods on which I intended to gorge myself the instant I returned to civilization. Judging from the state of my consciousness at the time, millions of years of hominid evolution had produced nothing more transcendent than a craving for a cheeseburger and a chocolate milkshake.<br> <br>I found the experience of sitting undisturbed for three days amid pristine breezes and starlight, with nothing to do but contemplate the mystery of my existence, to be a source of perfect misery&#x2014;for which I could see not so much as a glimmer of my own contribution. My letters home, in their plaintiveness and self-pity, rivaled any written at Shiloh or Gallipoli.<br> <br>So I was more than a little surprised when several members of our party, most of whom were a decade older than I, described their days and nights of solitude in positive, even transformational terms. I simply didn&#x2019;t know what to make of their claims to happiness. How could someone&#x2019;s happiness increase when all the material sources of pleasure and distraction had been removed? At that age, the nature of my own mind did not interest me&#x2014;only my life did. And I was utterly oblivious to how different life would be if the quality of my mind were to change.<br> <br>Our minds are all we have. They are all we have ever had. And they are all we can offer others. This might not be obvious, especially when there are aspects of your life that seem in need of improvement&#x2014;when your goals are unrealized, or you are struggling to find a career, or you have relationships that need repairing. But it&#x2019;s the truth. Every experience you have ever had has been shaped by your mind. Every relationship is as good or as bad as it is because of the minds involved. If you are perpetually angry, depressed, confused, and unloving, or your attention is elsewhere, it won&#x2019;t matter how successful you become or who is in your life&#x2014;you won&#x2019;t enjoy any of it.<br> <br>Most of us could easily compile a list of goals we want to achieve or personal problems that need to be solved. But what is the real significance of every item on such a list? Everything we want to accomplish&#x2014;to paint the house, learn a new language, find a better job&#x2014;is something that promises that, if done, it would allow us to finally relax and enjoy our lives in the present. Generally speaking, this is a false hope. I&#x2019;m not denying the importance of achieving one&#x2019;s goals, maintaining one&#x2019;s health, or keeping one&#x2019;s children clothed and fed&#x2014;but most of us spend our time seeking happiness and security without acknowledging the underlying purpose of our search. Each of us is looking for a path back to the present: We are trying to find good enough reasons to be satisfied now.<br> <br>Acknowledging that this is the structure of the game we are playing allows us to play it differently. How we pay attention to the present moment largely determines the character of our experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives. Mystics and contemplatives have made this claim for ages&#x2014;but a growing body of scientific research now bears it out.<br> <br>A few years after my first painful encounter with solitude, in the winter of 1987, I took the drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as Ecstasy, and my sense of the human mind&#x2019;s potential shifted profoundly. Although MDMA would become ubiquitous at dance clubs and &#x201c;raves&#x201d; in the 1990s, at that time I didn&#x2019;t know anyone of my generation who had tried it. One evening, a few months before my twentieth birthday, a close friend and I decided to take the drug.<br> <br>The setting of our experiment bore little resemblance to the conditions of Dionysian abandon under which MDMA is now often consumed. We were alone in a house, seated across from each other on opposite ends of a couch, and engaged in quiet conversation as the chemical worked its way into our heads. Unlike other drugs with which we were by then familiar (marijuana and alcohol), MDMA produced no feeling of distortion in our senses. Our minds seemed completely clear.<br> <br>In the midst of this ordinariness, however, I was suddenly struck by the knowledge that I loved my friend. This shouldn&#x2019;t have surprised me&#x2014;he was, after all, one of my best friends. However, at that age I was not in the habit of dwelling on how much I loved the men in my life. Now I could feel that I loved him, and this feeling had ethical implications that suddenly seemed as profound as they now sound pedestrian on the page: I wanted him to be happy.<br> <br>That conviction came crashing down with such force that something seemed to give way inside me. In fact, the insight appeared to restructure my mind. My capacity for envy, for instance&#x2014;the sense of being diminished by the happiness or success of another person&#x2014;seemed like a symptom of mental illness that had vanished without a trace. I could no more have felt envy at that moment than I could have wanted to poke out my own eyes. What did I care if my friend was better looking or a better athlete than I was? If I could have bestowed those gifts on him, I would have. Truly wanting him to be happy made his happiness my own.<br> <br>A certain euphoria was creeping into these reflections, perhaps, but the general feeling remained one of absolute sobriety&#x2014;and of moral and emotional clarity unlike any I had ever known. It would not be too strong to say that I felt sane for the first time in my life. And yet the change in my consciousness seemed entirely straightforward. I was simply talking to my friend&#x2014;about what, I don&#x2019;t recall&#x2014;and realized that I had ceased to be concerned about myself. I was no longer anxious, self-critical, guarded by irony, in competition, avoiding embarrassment, ruminating about the past and future, or making any other gesture of thought or attention that separated me from him. I was no longer watching myself through another person&#x2019;s eyes.<br> <br>And then came the insight that irrevocably transformed my sense of how good human life could be. I was feeling boundless love for one of my best friends, and I suddenly realized that if a stranger had walked through the door at that moment, he or she would have been fully included in this love. Love was at bottom impersonal&#x2014;and deeper than any personal history could justify. Indeed, a transactional form of love&#x2014;I love you because&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. &#x2014;now made no sense at all.<br> <br>The interesting thing about this final shift in perspective was that it was not driven by any change in the way I felt. I was not overwhelmed by a new feeling of love. The insight had more the character of a geometric proof: It was as if, having glimpsed the properties of one set of parallel lines, I suddenly understood what must be common to them all.<br> <br>The moment I could find a voice with which to speak, I discovered that this epiphany about the universality of love could be readily communicated. My friend got the point at once: All I had to do was ask him how he would feel in the presence of a total stranger at that moment, and the same door opened in his mind. It was simply obvious that love, compassion, and joy in the joy of others extended without limit. The experience was not of love growing but of its being no longer obscured. Love was&#x2014;as advertised by mystics and crackpots through the ages&#x2014;a state of being. How had we not seen this before? And how could we overlook it ever again?<br> <br>It would take me many years to put this experience into context. Until that moment, I had viewed organized religion as merely a monument to the ignorance and superstition of our ancestors. But I now knew that Jesus, the Buddha, Lao Tzu, and the other saints and sages of history had not all been epileptics, schizophrenics, or frauds. I still considered the world&#x2019;s religions to be mere intellectual ruins, maintained at enormous economic and social cost, but I now understood that important psychological truths could be found in the rubble.<br> <br>Twenty percent of Americans describe themselves as &#x201c;spiritual but not religious.&#x201d; Although the claim seems to annoy believers and atheists equally, separating spirituality from religion is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. It is to assert two important truths simultaneously: Our world is dangerously riven by religious doctrines that all educated people should condemn, and yet there is more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit. One purpose of this book is to give both these convictions intellectual and empirical support.<br> <br>Before going any further, I should address the animosity that many readers feel toward the term spiritual. Whenever I use the word, as in referring to meditation as a &#x201c;spiritual practice,&#x201d; I hear from fellow skeptics and atheists who think that I have committed a grievous error.<br> <br>The word spirit comes from the Latin spiritus, which is a translation of the Greek pneuma, meaning &#x201c;breath.&#x201d; Around the thirteenth century, the term became entangled with beliefs about immaterial souls, supernatural beings, ghosts, and so forth. It acquired other meanings as well: We speak of the spirit of a thing as its most essential principle or of certain volatile substances and liquors as spirits. Nevertheless, many nonbelievers now consider all things &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; to be contaminated by medieval superstition.<br> <br>I do not share their semantic concerns.1 Yes, to walk the aisles of any &#x201c;spiritual&#x201d; bookstore is to confront the yearning and credulity of our species by the yard, but there is no other term&#x2014;apart from the even more problematic mystical or the more restrictive contemplative&#x2014;with which to discuss the efforts people make, through meditation, psychedelics, or other means, to fully bring their minds into the present or to induce nonordinary states of consciousness. And no other word links this spectrum of experience to our ethical lives.<br> <br>Throughout this book, I discuss certain classically spiritual phenomena, concepts, and practices in the context of our modern understanding of the human mind&#x2014;and I cannot do this while restricting myself to the terminology of ordinary experience. So I will use spiritual, mystical, contemplative, and transcendent without further apology. However, I will be precise in describing the experiences and methods that merit these terms.<br> <br>For many years, I have been a vocal critic of religion, and I won&#x2019;t ride the same hobbyhorse here. I hope that I have been sufficiently energetic on this front that even my most skeptical readers will trust that my bullshit detector remains well calibrated as we advance over this new terrain. Perhaps the following assurance can suffice for the moment: Nothing in this book needs to be accepted on faith. Although my focus is on human subjectivity&#x2014;I am, after all, talking about the nature of experience itself&#x2014;all my assertions can be tested in the laboratory of your own life. In fact, my goal is to encourage you to do just that.<br> <br>Authors who attempt to build a bridge between science and spirituality tend to make one of two mistakes: Scientists generally start with an impoverished view of spiritual experience, assuming that it must be a grandiose way of describing ordinary states of mind&#x2014;parental love, artistic inspiration, awe at the beauty of the night sky. In this vein, one finds Einstein&#x2019;s amazement at the intelligibility of Nature&#x2019;s laws described as though it were a kind of mystical insight.<br> <br>New Age thinkers usually enter the ditch on the other side of the road: They idealize altered states of consciousness and draw specious connections between subjective experience and the spookier theories at the frontiers of physics. Here we are told that the Buddha and other contemplatives anticipated modern cosmology or quantum mechanics and that by transcending the sense of self, a person can realize his identity with the One Mind that gave birth to the cosmos.<br> <br>In the end, we are left to choose between pseudo-spirituality and pseudo-science.<br> <br>Few scientists and philosophers have developed strong skills of introspection&#x2014;in fact, most doubt that such abilities even exist. Conversely, many of the greatest contemplatives know nothing about science. But there is a connection between scientific fact and spiritual wisdom, and it is more direct than most people suppose. Although the insights we can have in meditation tell us nothing about the origins of the universe, they do confirm some well-established truths about the human mind: Our conventional sense of self is an illusion; positive emotions, such as compassion and patience, are teachable skills; and the way we think directly influences our experience of the world.<br> <br>There is now a large literature on the psychological benefits of meditation. Different techniques produce long-lasting changes in attention, emotion, cognition, and pain perception, and these correlate with both structural and functional changes in the brain. This field of research is quickly growing, as is our understanding of self-awareness and related mental phenomena. Given recent advances in neuroimaging technology, we no longer face a practical impediment to investigating spiritual insights in the context of science.<br> <br>Spirituality must be distinguished from religion&#x2014;because people of every faith, and of none, have had the same sorts of spiritual experiences. While these states of mind are usually interpreted through the lens of one or another religious doctrine, we know that this is a mistake. Nothing that a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu can experience&#x2014;self-transcending love, ecstasy, bliss, inner light&#x2014;constitutes evidence in support of their traditional beliefs, because their beliefs are logically incompatible with one another. A deeper principle must be at work.<br> <br>That principle is the subject of this book: The feeling that we call &#x201c;I&#x201d; is an illusion. There is no discrete self or ego living like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain. And the feeling that there is&#x2014;the sense of being perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself&#x2014;can be altered or entirely extinguished. Although such experiences of &#x201c;self-transcendence&#x201d; are generally thought about in religious terms, there is nothing, in principle, irrational about them. From both a scientific and a philosophical point of view, they represent a clearer understanding of the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the self, is what is meant by &#x201c;spirituality&#x201d; in the context of this book.<br> <br>Confusion and suffering may be our birthright, but wisdom and happiness are available. The landscape of human experience includes deeply transformative insights about the nature of one&#x2019;s own consciousness, and yet it is obvious that these psychological states must be understood in the context of neuroscience, psychology, and related fields....</p><h2>Elite: A Hunter novel (A Hunter Novel, 2)</h2><p><p>Joy knows she'll be facing more dangerous Othersiders than ever before as a new member of the Elite Hunter unit, but if anyone is up to the challenge it's her.

Every week it draws millions and millions of viewers to the edge of their seats as independent dealers and specialists from the country's leading auction houses appraise family heirlooms and flea market finds alike. Now this knowledge, authority, and passion is distilled in the Antiques Roadshow Primer, an introductory guide to American Antiques and collectibles.<p> Antiques Roadshow has taught us to look for fortunes in our attics--perhaps to find, as other lucky souls have, an Anna Poole Peale portrait miniature worth $5,000 to $7,000 or a Confederate sword worth $35,000. Focusing on 11 major areas--including Furniture, Painting, Silver, Jewelry, Porcelain, and Toys--the primer addresses the essential things buyers and collectors need to know, covering vital details for each category, such as shapes, styles, and patterns, provenance, periods, and motifs. A 32-page full-color section amplifies each chapter by illustrating numerous examples of styles and techniques, and individual items are fully identified, often with their appraised value. Above all, it helps even first-timers to answer the two key question every collector must face: Is it old? Is it valuable?</p><p></p></p><p>The simple but brilliant attraction of the popular PBS series is that deep down inside, everyone wonders if that family heirloom or flea-market antique in the corner of the living room has any real value. <i>Antiques Roadshow Primer</i> can help you answer that question. Carol Prisant, who writes about antiques and collectibles for <i>Martha Stewart Living</i>, <i>House Beautiful</i>, and <i>New York</i>, quickly notes in her introduction, however, that this is a primer--an introduction to the basics of antiques--and does not presume to make the reader an instant expert.<p> In that vein, the focus is on the bread and butter of the antique world: silver, glass, pottery, porcelain, books, paintings, jewelry, rugs, clocks, and furniture. These are the items that are not trendy (Barbie dolls, 1920s beaded bags) and subject to massive fluctuations in price and value. Instead, Prisant points out, they are the types of items that are good for the long haul and, she notes, the front hall. So how do you determine if an heirloom is worth something? The following tips are offered when inspecting furniture: run your fingers underneath or over the back of the piece--very sharp edges and corners indicate recent manufacture. Remove one screw in some inconspicuous spot. An old, handmade screw will have irregular widths between the spirals, running the whole length of the shaft. The slot in the head may be off-center. Look for the distinctive curved pattern left in sawn wood by the teeth of a circular saw--it is one important sign of manufacture after 1840. </p><p> Prisant also reveals tricks of the trade for inspecting diamonds: place the gem against your upper lip, she advises. If it's glass--the oldest imitator of a diamond--it will not feel cold at all, while a real diamond will. Definitions are also offered for "antique furniture" (any object 100 years old or older, according to the U.S. government), "used furniture" (secondhand furniture less than 100 years old), and "period furniture" (made when its design was first popular and new; generally the most valuable of antique furniture). At its best, <i>Antiques Roadshow Primer</i> instills a sense of genuine interest and enthusiasm, much like the PBS show, by making the antiques and collectibles world less of a stuffy discussion about an untouchable item behind lock and key and more about drawing connections to the heirloom in the corner. <i>--John Russell</i></p>Through its traveling events and enormously popular series on PBS, Antiques Roadshow has taught us to look for hidden treasures in our attics--perhaps to find, as other lucky souls have, a Baltimore album quilt worth $50,000 or a Seymour card table like the one picked up at a garage sale for $25 and subsequently appraised at $200,000.<p> Now beginning collectors, antiques lovers, auction-goers, and flea-market mavens can extend their knowledge and hone their instincts with the Antiques Roadshow Primer. A take-you-by-the-hand introductory guide, the primer focuses on traditional categories of antiques and collectibles, including jewelry, silver, paintings, furniture, dolls, toys, metalwork, and porcelain. Not only each chapter but each lively page is brimming with information, providing and introductory overview that will help transform the enthusiast into a connoisseur.</p><p> Take "Furniture," for example. It explains how our own craftsmen interpreted and "Americanized" a melting pot of styles like Chippendale and French Empire. How to identify the four categories of old furniture: antique, used, reproduction, and, best of all, period, How to distinguish between old and new veneer and find the distinct pattern of a circular saw, indicating a piece made after 1840. And all of this comes just in the first five pages.</p><p> Along the way extensive illustrations, photographs, and charts show both classic and quirky examples, highlighting important visual details, tracing the history of artists and styles, and capturing pertinent Roadshow discoveries. Experts in the field contribute their own tips, sharing such secrets as how to use a scratch test to tell if a stone is Imperial jade or nephrite, and why ill-defined fingers on a bronze statue mean it's a reproduction.</p><p> Every collector asks two questions about a piece: Is it old? Is it valuable? And every page of the Antiques Roadshow Primer helps to supply the answer.</p></p><h2>Runaway Dream: Born to Run and Bruce Springsteen&#39;s American Vision</h2><p>A rich history of Springsteen&#x20ac;&#x2122;s greatest album, celebrating its themes of youth, escape, and possibility, just in time for the Boss&#x20ac;&#x2122;s sixtieth birthday.

The gorilla answers by quietly pickpocketing the guard's keys, stealthily trailing him, and unlocking the cages of every animal the oblivious fellow bids goodnight to. Looking much like an exhausted father, the uniformed guard traipses home toward his cottage, while the lonely zoo animals softly parade behind him. The animals manage to slip into his bedroom and nestle unnoticed near his sleepy wife--until the bold little gorilla goes so far as to snuggle up beside her as she turns out the light. Author and illustrator Peggy Rathmann (creator of the Caldecott-winning <i>Officer Buckle and Gloria</i>) relies more on the nuances of her jewel-toned pictures than on words to pace this giggly bedtime story, making it perfect for observant preschoolers. In one inky-black spread, Rathmann lets only the shocked, wide-open eyes of the guard's wife tell us that the gorilla has been detected! Tiny details such as the faithful, banana-toting mouse and sky-bound pink balloon that appear in each picture keep this book fresh, magical, and fun--even after countless bedtime readings.

Popular in the eighteenth century, this book explores the full potential of this method and encourages you to experiment." - KarenPlatt.co.uk</p><p>"First impressions of this softback are that it is very colourful and attractive. The introduction promises a solid foundation from which to conduct an exploration of a versatile weave structure with unlimited possibilities, which is precisely what the reader gets. After a brief history, we are plunged straight into 'How doubleweave works' with very clear diagrams, good illustrations and thorough descriptive text. This is followed by an outline of warp preparation and dressing the loom specifically for doubleweave. This book is not aimed at complete beginners, a basic knowledge of weaving terms and four-shaft weaving on a table loom is assumed, also the ability to interpret threading and tie-up diagrams. After this, the first sampler on four shafts is covered in detail, including the usual combinations of layers, tubes and double-width cloth. This is followed by rather more unusual suggestions such as 'quilting' in decorative patterns using a pick-up stick and weaving finger-manipulated laces against a plain background, finishing with an extensive chapter on doubleweave pickup. By this time I was itching to weave the sampler myself - but no time - so continue reading! Further chapters on possibilities for four shafts continue, followed by exploring doubleweave with eight or more shafts. These include a few projects which act as very useful sampling opportunities, even though the finished items are not that exciting. The general description of weaving double, triple or quadruple cloth on eight or more shafts is complicated, but rewards careful reading. Again, the diagrams and illustrations are excellent. The book concludes with a short chapter suggesting ideas for further reading and exploration. I'm now hooked; can't wait to get started." - <i>Journal for Weavers, Spinners &amp; Dyers</i></p></p><h2>The Waldorf Homeschool Handbook</h2><p>The Waldorf Homeschool Handbook is a simple step-by-step guide to creating and understanding a Waldorf inspired homeschool plan.

By the author of Mrs. Keppel and Her Daughter.</p><p>Diana Souhami is the author of many widely acclaimed books. She has also written plays for radio and television.&#34;Wild Girls is a wonderful evocation of an era and of a relationship frightening in both its intensity and its bleakness. It is interspersed with tales of Souhami&#39;s own life in London bars or cafes... This gives fuel to the contention that all biography is covert autobiography: we seize and dwell on those elements of our subject&#39;s life that illuminate our own.&#34; -- JAD ADAMS * GUARDIAN * Diana Souhami tells the story of those years with her usual wit and detail... what Souhami makes clear is that we are not only talking about sexual difference but about a completely different way of living. -- JEANETTE WINTERSON * THE TIMES * Diana Souhami, in writing about a book about them and the significant others in each of their lives has produced a series of miniatures that add up to a group portrait of a singular society that flourished in Paris (and as Souhami points out, would have been impossible anywhere else) during the first third of the 20th century... an exceptionally witty and original biographer. * SUNDAY TIMES * Natalie&#39;s salon and Romaine&#39;s paintings may be no more than cultural footnotes, but their love, in all its tortured resistless grandeur, deserves a kind of immortality. -- Jonathan Keates * LITERARY REVIEW * Diana Souhami&#39;s cunning insertion of occasional vignettes from her own, rather less opulent existence as a modern gay woman enhances our awareness that this book is as much a tribute to lesbian fulfilment as a straightforward chronicle of its subjects&#39; lives. Her skill, not just in garnering detail, but in finding the perfect place for, is unrivalled? -- Jonathan Keates * LITERARY REVIEW * Far more intriguing is something that lies outside this story altogether. At the start of each chapter is placed a short passage in itallics, never more than a paragraph or two. Here the author seems to be narrating some of her personal lesbian experiences.... These are fascinating and I sincerely hope Ms Souhami will expand them and produce her own memoir of life as a wild girl. -- SELINA HASTINGS * SUNDAY TELEGRAPH * Diana Souhami describes the whole complex relationship well, particularly the poignancy of the final years in the lives of her two Wild Girls.... Pages are crammed with descriptions of exotic characters, their extravagances and eccentricities, the lillies, the pearls, the velvet-lined rooms... -- SELINA HASTINGS * SUNDAY TELEGRAPH *</p><h2>Process Color Manual, 24,000 CMYK Combinations for Design, Prepress, and Printing</h2><p>Today graphic design is done almost exclusively on screen, where colors look different than when they are printed. To help designers and the people who work with them address this critical disparity, authors Michael and Pat Rogondino have completely revised and expanded their standard manual, Computer Color (0-87701-739-5). A boon for all designers, production people, artists, and printers, Process Color Manual provides an astounding 24,000 colors that match from computer display to printed page. The standard-issue Pantone color books, by comparison, can cost as much as $175 and offer only 3000 colors! Also included with the book is a handy cardboard mask, white on one side and black on the other, that allows the user to isolate a specific block of color. This sturdy color guide partly came about due to demand from the people who have sworn by the previous edition: Chronicle Books designers.

Her intensely moving true story of Sheila, a silent, profoundly disturbed little six-year-old girl touched millions. From every corner of the world came letters from readers wanting to know more about the troubled child who had come into Torey Hayden's class as a"hopeless case," and emerged as the very symbol of eternal hope within the human spirit.</p><p>Now, for all those who have never forgotten this endearing child and her remarkable relationship with her teacher, here is the surprising story of Sheila, the young woman.</p></p><p><p>Torey Hayden is an educational psychologist and a former special education teacher who since 1979 has chronicled her struggles in the classroom in a succession of bestselling books. She lives and writes in the U.K.</p>Abandoned by her mother on a highway at age four, abused by her drug-addict father between his prison stints, autistic, electively mute Sheila Renstad at age six broke through her silent rage to communicate, aided by her five-month relationship with special-education teacher Hayden. That experience, recorded in Hayden's One Child, which became a TV movie, is updated in this deeply moving sequel. It picks up with Sheila as a sullen 13-year-old bouncing between juvenile facilities and her father's "care." As Hayden renews her ties to Sheila?first at a clinic, then through informal contacts?the girl's outbursts and foul-mouthed sexual preoccupations betray a desperate craving for a sense of belonging. An inspirational testament to the healing power of love, this authentic tearjerker resonates with drama. There is no storybook ending: Sheila, with an IQ over 180, forgoes college to work for McDonald's; an epilogue finds her 10 years later as a branch manager at McDonald's and an articulate, stable woman.

These were the thought of Bernard Moitessier after he finished writing his last book, Tamata and the Alliance, while in Polynesia.<br><br>The great master died in 1994 and never completed the book, but here it is, meticulously collected from hus many writings, published and unpublished, by his companion V�ronique Lerebours Pigeonni�re. Moitessier's notebooks include all the know-how and the 1001 tips of this legendary sailor, the knowledge he acquired on the water, in meeting with sailors, during long passages, and during his many years living on various islands. The first part of the book details how to prepare for an extensive cruise, what kind of boat to choose, the rigging, the sails, the anchors, on deck and below deck. The second part describes the passage: the weather, navigation, watch-keeping, and heavy weather. In the third part, Moitessier takes us to the South Sea islands and shows how to adapt to living on an atoll, gardening, fishing and attaining self-sufficiency.</p><p>Bernard Moitessier was one of the greatest ocean voyagers. He became a legend in his own time. Born in 1925 in Indochina, he gained much of his sailing knowledge from the fishermen of the Gulf of Siam. A gifted writer, he wrote four books describing his seagoing adventures, including the major autobiographical work Tamata and the Alliance.Together with what you learn in books, don't hesitate to get your feet wet by sailing a small dinghy such as an Optimist. You'll learn a tremendous amount. You may think, "Me, in an Optimist? That's a kid's boat! People will make fun of me!" To that I would say, "Beware of pride!" <p>A few years ago in Tahiti, my friends Ren and Jocelyne had acquired a 27-foot sloop. He was 33 and a real athlete; he did martial arts, parachute-jumping, body surfing, and some diving, among other things. At 25, Jocelyne wasn't the least bit interested in sports, but she had good common sense. Neither had ever done any sailing, except for a trip to Moorea with a bunch of friends aboard a 60-foot ketch, and they asked me to show them the ropes. The Arue yacht club agreed to lend us a Caravelle, a big, dry-sailing centerboard boat that at first glance seemed ideal. But when we got to the yacht club, we were greeted by a swarm of 10- to 12-year old children who were about to go out on Optimists. We watched as they cleared the harbor area. One of the kids, though obviously at a loss, managed to get out of the channel despite the crowding and jeers of his friends. An hour later, the children returned like a swarm of bees. And we saw something eye-opening: the hapless kid of an hour before had been transformed. He was doing just as well as the others, yelling "starboard" at any challengers, deftly handling the crosswinds in the narrow channel before raising his centerboard and sailing up the ramp. </p><p>We helped him stow his gear and asked, "How long have you been sailing an Optimist?" Answer: "This is my first time." In a blinding flash, we were struck by the obvious, so Ren, Jocelyne, and I immediately set sail, each aboard one of those marvelous dinghies. Close reach, reach, beam reach, coming about, jibing, backing with reverse rudder. We checked to see how well the boats hove to with the sail sheeted in and the tiller down at 45 degrees. The wind rose and we watched for gusts, learning to anticipate shifts as a Force 4 wind raised little whitecaps on the lagoon. Ren and Jocelyne were beginning to take charge of their boats. Just for the heck of it, we started racing. It was terrific fun: we were in seventh heaven! </p><p>When we headed back a couple of hours later, nobody could have said which of us had sailed the most miles in his life. It was extraordinary: in a single outing, Ren and Jocelyne had grasped the essentials because each was responsible for everything, from beginning to end. </p><p>When you're sailing alone, you pay for the slightest mistake or lapse of attention. But an Optimist is a forgiving boat, and it gives you fair warning; you really have to work to turn one over. A 14-foot 420, on the other hand, is a temperamental racing dinghy that I feel is much too fast and unpredictable for a beginner. If nothing else is available, sailing a 420 is obviously a lot better that sitting on the yacht club terrace. But as soon as the wind rises a notch, a 420 will dump you without giving you the time to understand why or how. So I don't think it's the best way to quickly learn to sail well. </p><p>As for learning in a group aboard a Caravelle, a number of things can make this inconvenient and a waste of time. You have a skipper at the helm--who may or may not be a good teacher-- and a crew, the people who do the work. The two most eager students usually grab the jib sheets and the others become "moveable ballast": they aren't very motivated, and their attention wanders as soon as they start getting bored or cold. Meanwhile the two people at the sheets start thinking it's high time they took a turn at the tiller. But you don't get the tiller just like that; you have to earn it, you have to deserve it. "Trim your jib a little better," says the skipper. "No, not like that! Are you asleep, or what? How did I ever get such a crew? And you want to take the helm too?"</p></p><h2>State of Slim: Fix Your Metabolism and Drop 20 Pounds in 8 Weeks on the Colorado Diet</h2><p>Americans are getting fatter. A third of them are now obese-not just a few pounds overweight, but heavy enough to put their health in jeopardy. But, one state bucks the trend. Colorado is the leanest state in the nation, but not because of something in the air or the water. Rather, it's where diet, activity, and environment perfectly intersect.<br>From their Denver-based research facility, leading weight-loss experts Dr. James Hill and Dr. Holly Wyatt set out to discover why Coloradans are so slim and how they stay that way. They studied the patients in their weight-loss clinic along with the lean people of Colorado. They also looked for clues in the National Weight Control Registry, a scientific database of thousands of successful "losers" across the country who have dropped an average of 70 pounds and kept it off for 6 years. Their comparison of these groups led to an aha moment-the discovery of 6 simple habits that keep people in a state of slim.<br>With proof that you can live like a lean Coloradan anywhere, Hill and Wyatt used those 6 habits as the foundation for their revolutionary plan, the Colorado Diet. Unlike most "diets," this one reveals the secrets of people who are in the state of slim, whether it's because they've always been slender or because they've lost weight and kept it off over the long term. This is critical, because what you need to do to for long-term weight maintenance is different from what you do to lose weight. You must repair your metabolism. If you don't, you can drop pounds, but you won't keep them off. The NWCR participants and Colorado residents had intuitively uncovered the right blend of food, activity, and habits that keep metabolism in top working order. Follow their lead, and you'll be able to actually eat <i>more</i> food and still stay at a healthy weight. <br>The Colorado Diet is divided into three phases with very clear objectives: <i>Reignite</i>, <i>Rebuild</i>, and <i>Reinforce</i> your metabolism. In the Reignite and Rebuild phases, you'll drop 20 pounds in just 8 weeks as you discover how to eat and move so that you are working with, rather than against, your body's metabolism. With a new, flexible metabolism, you'll progress into the Reinforce phase, where you'll continue to lose weight and solidify your new lifestyle. Along the way, you'll learn how to make changes in your environment and your mind-set so they support, rather than thwart, your success. By following the Colorado Diet, you'll get your body into a <i>State of Slim</i> for good.</p><p>James O. Hill is executive director of the Anschutz Center for Health and Wellness at the University of Colorado and the author of <i>The Step Diet: Count Steps, Not Calories to Lose Weight and Keep It off Forever</i>. He and Dr. Wyatt co-founded the National Weight Control Registry. He lives in Denver, CO.<br><br>Holly Wyatt, the Anschutz Center's associate director, is a physician and clinical researcher at the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado and the national director for the Centers for Obesity Research and Education. She lives in Denver, CO.What Makes Colorado Special?<br><br>CHAPTER 1<br><br>WE'RE FREQUENTLY ASKED BY the media and by people we meet at parties why America is getting so fat. Is it because we spend too much time sitting in front of the TV? Is it because we drink those huge sugary soft drinks or that junk food advertising is often geared toward kids? Everyone has an opinion: Healthy food is too expensive. Schools are the problem, since most did away with recess and serve unhealthy food. Our portion sizes are too big, and we're eating too many wheat-based products. The list is endless. People want to blame someone or one specific thing--and everyone wants a simple solution.<br><br>There's no doubt that overweight and obesity are huge health problems in our country. Americans have been gaining weight year after year since the early 1980s. In fact, we published a study in Science in 2003 showing that the average weight gain in adults is about 2 �ds per year. This may not seem like a lot, but it adds up to 20 extra �ds in a decade!<br><br>What has caused this increase in weight gain? The American lifestyle has changed so much in the past 30 years--nearly everything about the places we live, work, and play is different--that it's impossible to assign blame to any one, two, or even three things. More important, though, we don't believe that "Why is America getting so fat?" is the right question. There are people who are lean and healthy. Some of them have always been this way; others have managed to lose weight and keep it off for a very long time. We've been asking, "How do these people do it?" With the Colorado Diet, our focus is on what people have done right.<br><br>Colorado is a perfect learning laboratory in which to study what's effective and what isn't for weight loss because there are many, many people here doing it right. While the rest of the nation has been packing on the �ds, Coloradans have avoided the high rates of obesity seen elsewhere. The state has the lowest obesity prevalence in the nation, about 26 percent below the national average. However, not everyone in Colorado is lean--just being a Coloradan doesn't give you immunity against the factors that contribute to obesity. You have to live the Colorado lifestyle actively.<br><br>In studying the Colorado lifestyle, we discovered six key factors that make healthy living easy and are necessary for developing a Mile-High Metabolism (we describe this in greater detail in Chapter 2). We think they explain why Coloradans are the leanest people in the nation. What's more, in comparing the habits of lean Coloradans to those of the participants in the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR), we determined that you don't need be a Colorado resident to adopt this lifestyle. Those people live across the country, proving you can be a weight-loss success story anywhere. In the chapters that follow, we'll go into greater detail about each one of the factors and show you how to incorporate them into your daily life. But for now, we wanted to give you an overview.<br><br>1 / Be Active Every Day<br><br>A few years ago, we worked with Harris Polls to research the walking habits of people across the United States and published the results in the journal Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise. Participants wore pedometers to count the number of steps they took each day. Turns out that the national average was about 5,500 steps (about 2 to 21/2 miles), but Coloradans took 1,000 additional steps. We weren't surprised to find that obesity rates were correlated to the number of steps taken. In Arkansas and Tennessee, where obesity rates are among the highest in the country, residents took only 4,500 steps per day.<br><br>There's no getting around it--to stay lean, you must be consistently active. Without regular movement, your metabolism becomes slow, sluggish, and inflexible. And an inflexible metabolism makes weight gain inevitable and lasting weight loss next to impossible. Whether it's a walk with the dog, a hike with a friend, a bike ride, or a workout at the gym, movement is a priority in Colorado, not another dreaded task on the to-do list. Some of us get up early, others fit it in between obligations, but the key is we always find a way.<br><br>If this feels foreign and seems daunting to you now, don't despair. In Chapter 4, we help you discover the joy of movement and show you how to make it part of your life.<br><br>2 / Fuel Up on Real Food<br><br>With all that activity, Coloradans love to eat, but we're selective about our food. We look for fresh and local fare, sustainably grown and harvested, where possible. Just about every neighborhood has a farmers' market, and health and organic food stores are very popular, too. (In fact, several major health food chains originated in Colorado.) The majority of our calories come from minimally processed foods that deliver the most flavor and nutrition so our bodies perform at their best. We don't waste our calories on foods with low nutritional value, although we do love our occasional indulgences.<br><br>A passion for adventure and new experiences is common here, and food is no exception. Many Coloradans identify as "foodies" and love to cook and seek out inventive restaurants that serve fresh, delicious meals. At restaurants and at home, the emphasis is on quality, not quantity. A healthy-size portion of a great-tasting dish is better than a huge serving of fare that's filled with refined carbohydrates, fat, and sodium--even if that big portion costs less money.<br><br>Our friends Debbie and Tim exemplify the Colorado Diet philosophy we discuss in Chapter 5. They love to cook, and even though they live in downtown Denver, they grow their own vegetables in the neighborhood community garden. On a typical Sunday, they might walk or bike to the grocery stores in their neighborhood to pick up a few ingredients for dinner. Debbie prefers making simple meals with fresh ingredients. One of their favorite dinners is sauteed vegetables and herbs tossed with pasta and topped with a little Parmesan cheese--it's tasty, and Debbie can put it together in just a few minutes after work. The couple joined a local farm share program that provides them with a box of fresh, locally produced foods each week. They are both lean and active and readily admit that a major reason they are active is to be able to enjoy the food they love.<br><br>3 / Create Your Own Healthy Environment<br><br>Colorado is famous for its beautiful scenery and ample opportunities for outdoor recreation. Active people are drawn to our state because of our weather (more than 300 days of sunshine a year), mountains, walking and biking trails, and lots of parks and open spaces. It's hard to stay inside. Of course, it's easier to be active when you're in this kind of environment.<br><br>But the typical Coloradan doesn't hike a tall peak before breakfast every day--or even once a month. It's our communities and immediate surroundings-- the plethora of parks, the bike paths in our neighborhoods, and our friendly walking groups--that provide an important nudge for healthy living.<br><br>And if you're looking for someone to join you on a hike or a bike ride, you don't have to look far. In Colorado, you're likely to rub elbows with a triathlete or trail runner or hiker at a movie, party, or neighborhood event. Your neighbor may be the local running club coach or the organizer of a local charity walk. It seems like everyone owns a bike and a dog. It's not uncommon to begin conversations by talking about the last race you walked or ran rather than what you do for a living. These interactions make living an active lifestyle the norm. This "social circle effect" is exemplified by research done at Harvard University that found that people in the same social network (i.e., groups of friends) tended to have similar body mass indices (body mass index is a measure of obesity). If you're surrounded by friends and family who are overweight, you're more likely to be overweight. Now, this doesn't mean that obesity is contagious; rather it's just that you're likely to engage in the same eating and physical activity patterns as the people you spend most of your time with. And it goes both ways--surround yourself with active people and you become more active, too.<br><br>4 / Stay True to Your Purpose<br><br>We all have an inner purpose (what we want to accomplish with our lives), but you may not have ever connected your purpose with weight-loss success. Consider this: Is the way you are living your life consistent with what you want to achieve? For Coloradans, being in good shape physically gives them the energy and confidence to do the things that are most important to them, whether it's about providing for family, achieving professional success, or pursuing what they've always wanted to do in retirement. If you recognize how losing weight and keeping it off will help you better reach your goals in life, you will have a powerful motivator to succeed. Making that connection is what spurs you to get up early to hit the gym--even if it's icy cold outside--or gives you the willpower to pass on the second portion at dinner. Living healthfully then becomes a key value in your life and provides motivation for everything you do--and that makes it much more likely that you will enjoy the Colorado lifestyle. Finding your purpose and connecting it to your weight loss goals is an essential factor for success. It's part of the Colorado mind-set we discuss in Chapter 3.<br><br>5 / Believe You Can Succeed<br><br>During your weight-loss journey, you will face many challenges and small setbacks. Dealing with them in a way that doesn't derail your plan requires keeping a positive mind-set. Your mental outlook can determine how effective you are in making permanent changes in your life. If you believe you can't do something, you probably won't. For you to succeed in losing weight and keeping it off, you have to have faith in your power to change and not get caught up in thinking you're a victim and have no control over the things you perceive as barriers to success. It sounds simplistic, but the idea that having a positive attitude can help you achieve amazing results is backed by science. Research psychologist Barbara Fredrickson, PhD, at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a leader in the field of positive psychology, has shown that cultivating a positive mind- set can enhance relationships, improve work performance, reduce depression, and contribute to better health. In general, Coloradans have an upbeat attitude. It's not that everyone is running around happy all the time. It's more a sensibility that you are responsible for your own happiness. Instead of saying, "I'll believe it when I see it," Coloradans tend to have the mind-set that if you believe it, you will see it. (Chapter 3 discusses this concept in greater detail.)<br><br>It's our experience that people who choose to see a lifestyle change in positive terms do much better than those who don't. Consider Melissa, who came to our weight-loss clinic with a negative mind-set. She was constantly talking about all the foods she couldn't eat on her diet plan. She bemoaned the absence of a chocolate dough-nut every morning and complained that Sunday football was just not the same without chicken wings, pizza, and her favorite cold beer. She had to exercise every day, and that meant getting up earlier--and she hated getting up earlier. She was losing weight but struggling and even told us we were making her life miserable. You could feel the negative energy when you were in the room with her.<br><br>To turn things around, we made it a priority to get her to concentrate on what she liked about her new lifestyle. Each time we met, we asked her to tell us two things she really enjoyed that week and two things she was grateful for. Over time, her mind-set shifted from feeling like a victim to feeling empowered by her ability to create a new way of living. She began to appreciate the opportunities and not chafe against the requirements of her new lifestyle. Melissa not only lost 40 �ds but has kept them off for over a year. We even overheard her telling a new patient that you have the power to make this a great experience or a terrible one--it's your choice.<br><br>PARACHUTING INTO WELLNESS<br><br>In September 2011, our colleague John Peters, PhD, moved to Denver from Cincinnati to join our group at the Anschutz Health and Wellness Center. He didn't come here seeking to lose weight. Instead, it happened accidentally. We'll let him explain.<br><br>I'd visited Colorado many times over the years and always felt drawn to its natural beauty--the Rocky Mountains, the intense sunlight, and the infinite blue sky. When I decided to move here from Ohio, I felt as if I'd literally parachuted into wellness.<br><br>One of the first things I noticed in Colorado was the bicycles--they were everywhere! I've always been a cyclist, but until I relocated to Denver, I had to put my bike on the car roof and drive somewhere to ride. Now, in my neighborhood, I'm only a half mile from the High Line Canal bike trail. I hop on my bike at home and ride to the trailhead. There I can connect to a large network of trails that can take me practically anywhere I want to go!<br><br>When I first moved in, I assumed my neighborhood was some sort of planned fitness community. People were out walking at all times of the day and night. But eventually, I realized that all this walking is perfectly normal in Colorado--whether there's a foot of snow on the ground or it is 100 degrees outside, people are outside doing something active. A park across the street from my home has a 2-mile-long trail around it. The first month that I moved in, I signed up for a 5-K in my neighborhood park in hopes of meeting some new people. In a single weekend, I made connections with an entire group of people I could meet up with for outdoor activities.<br><br>My eating habits changed, too. My neighborhood has a farmers' market about 2 blocks away and a natural food store a few miles away, and both of them are on my Saturday grocery route. Surrounded by healthy food, it was much easier to eat well, no willpower required.</p><h2>Gutenberg&#39;s Apprentice: A Novel</h2><p><p></p><p>An enthralling literary debut that evokes one of the most momentous events in history, the birth of printing in medieval Germany&#x2014;a story of invention, intrigue, and betrayal, rich in atmosphere and historical detail, told through the lives of the three men who made it possible.</p><p>Youthful, ambitious Peter Schoeffer is on the verge of professional success as a scribe in Paris when his foster father, wealthy merchant and bookseller Johann Fust, summons him home to corrupt, feud-plagued Mainz to meet &#x201c;a most amazing man.&#x201d;</p><p>Johann Gutenberg, a driven and caustic inventor, has devised a revolutionary&#x2014;and to some, blasphemous&#x2014;method of bookmaking: a machine he calls a printing press.

They had signed up for this lovely New Age weekend down in Florida -- what was going on with this Natalie Goldberg? I knew only a handful had read any of my books. How was I going to leap over this mess smoothly and talk about writing practice, where I was on solid ground? I mentioned the horses from the seminar title -- ahh, relief on their faces -- they had come to the correct lecture hall after all.</p><p>Then everything dropped away. I had nothing to say.</p><p>���</p><p>So begins the journey by one of America's favorite writing teachers. Natalie Goldberg has inspired millions to write to develop an intimate relationship with their minds and a greater understanding of the world in which they live. Now, through this honest exploration of her own life, Goldberg puts her teachings to work.</p><p>In this wry, nimble memoir, Natalie Goldberg candidly depicts her father, Ben, an old-fashioned man's man who knew no boundaries -- a trait that was at once his greatest strength and most profound weakness. In capturing the essence of this larger-than-life Jewish bartender, she reveals the intricacies of a precarious father-daughter relationship. The tenuous bond with her father leads her in many directions and ultimately to Dainin Katagiri Roshi, a dynamic, celebrated Zen master. In light of an eye-opening discovery that shakes her ideal of this beloved teacher, Goldberg revisits her many years of loyal practice under Roshi's guidance.</p><p>Elegantly weaving these tales together, this story is finally a search for truth when there are no easy answers. Filled with Goldberg's trademark gifts for both humor and teaching, <em>The Great Failure</em> touches our hearts and minds as we come to recognize the ways in which we fail to confront our illusions.</p></p><p><p>Natalie Goldberg is the author of ten books, including <em>Writing Down the Bones</em>, which has sold over one million copies and has been translated into twelve languages. She has also written the beloved <em>Long Quiet Highway: Waking Up in America</em>, a memoir about her Zen teacher. For the last thirty years she has practiced Zen and taught seminars in writing as a spiritual practice. She lives in northern New Mexico.</p>"Of course, we are drawn to teachers that unconsciously mirror our own psychology," writes Goldberg in a memoir about her wrestling match with her particular devil. In <i>Writing Down the Bones</i>, she coupled writing with the insights of Zen Buddhism, showing writers how to use a stream of consciousness approach to move through blocks and understand their true experience. Here, however, as Goldberg explores the link between her elegant Zen master, Katagiri Roshi, and the gritty, charming bartender father who sexually violated her, she inadvertently demonstrates this approach's shortcoming. Years after his death, Goldberg learned that Katagiri, the teacher who taught her so much (and the subject of <i>Long Quiet Highway</i>), carried on affairs with female students. Goldberg was shattered; she'd wanted to believe he was an immaculate refuge. Liberation through disillusionment is a universal and durable theme, yet as Goldberg muses and tells stories&#x2014;splicing in a long Zen tale for a little extra-dimensional oomph&#x2014;her account closes rather than opens up. In spite of her fluid writing and honesty, the work feels insular and self-cherishing, like personal notes rather than a compelling narrative for the rest of us. Many readers will conclude that this is a not-so-great failure after all, or perhaps a heartache that hasn't really healed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

For more information, visit her website, www.debbiemacomber.com.<br><br>Anne Fletcher pulled the last box of Christmas decorations from the closet in the spare bedroom. She loved Christmas&#x2014;always had and always would, regardless of her circumstances. It was a bit early yet, a few days before Thanksgiving, but some Christmas cheer was exactly what she needed to get her mind off her problems. The grief that had been hounding her since the divorce five years ago... The financial uncertainty she now faced... The betrayal she still felt...<br><br>"No," she said aloud, refusing to allow herself to step closer to that swamp of regrets. It often happened like this. She'd start thinking about everything she'd lost, and before she knew it, she'd collapse emotionally, drowning in pain.<br><br>Carrying the plastic container down the hallway, she glanced inside her art room and let her gaze drift over to her easel and her latest project. The bold colors of the setting sun against the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean pleased her. Yes, she was divorced, but there'd been compensations, too. Her art had fulfilled her in ways she hadn't even realized were possible.<br><br>How different her life was at fifty-nine than she would've imagined even five years ago&#x2014;before the divorce. What Burton had done was unforgivable. He'd hurt her, and he'd cheated her out of funds that were rightfully hers.<br><br>Once again she stopped herself, not wanting to indulge those bitter memories and regrets. She'd done plenty of that in the beginning, when she'd first learned he'd found someone else and wanted out of their thirty-year marriage. It was a fling, or so she'd managed to convince herself. A midlife crisis. Lots of men had them. Any day Burton would come to his senses and see what he was doing to her and to Roy, their son.<br><br>Only he hadn't, and Anne walked out of divorce court numb with shock and disbelief. Not until the judge's gavel echoed through the room had she fully believed her husband was capable of such treachery. She should've known, should've been prepared. Burton was a top-notch divorce attorney, a persuasive man who knew all the ploys. But despite everything, she'd trusted him....<br><br>Her friends had been stunned, too&#x2014;less by Burton's deception than by Anne's apparent acceptance of what he'd done to her. It wasn't in her to fight, to drag her marriage and her life through the courts. Burton had recommended an attorney, whom she'd obediently retained, never suspecting that the man who'd represented her in court would apply to Burton's law firm as soon as the divorce was final. Of course, he'd been hired....<br><br>Burton had promised to treat her fairly. Because she was convinced that he'd soon recognize what a terrible mistake he was making, she'd blindly followed his lead. Without a quibble and on her attorney's advice, she'd accepted the settlement offer&#x2014;one that had turned out to be grossly unfair. Although she hadn't been aware of it at the time, Anne was cheated out of at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars' worth of assets.<br><br>Burton's ploy in this particular case had been simple: he'd strung her along. Twice he'd come to her in tears, begging her forgiveness, talking about reconciliation, and all the while he'd been shifting their assets to offshore accounts. All the while, he'd been lying, stealing and cheating. She'd loved him and she'd believed him, and so had taken her husband at his word. Never had she dreamed he could betray her like this. After thirty years, she'd walked away with only a pittance. And, needless to say, no alimony.<br><br>Yes, Anne could fight him, could take him back to court and expose him for the thief he was, but to what end? It was best, she'd decided long ago, to preserve her dignity. She'd always felt that life had a symmetry to it, a way of righting wrongs, and that somehow, eventually, God would restore to her the things she'd lost. It was this belief that had gotten her past the bitterness and indignation.<br><br>Admittedly she couldn't help lapsing sometimes, but Anne tried not to feel bitter. At this point, she couldn't see how anger, even righteous anger, could possibly benefit her. She'd adjusted. Taking the little she'd managed to salvage from her marriage, she'd purchased a small cottage on St. Gabriel, a tiny San Juan island in Puget Sound. In college all those years ago, when she'd met Burton, she'd been an art student. She had a flair for art and enjoyed it. Given the demands of being married to a prominent divorce lawyer, she'd put aside her own pursuits to assist Burton. Her husband's ambitions had become her own, and Anne was the perfect wife and hostess.<br><br>It'd been a disappointment to her to have only one child, a son they'd named after Anne's father. Young Roy was the light of her life, her ray of sunshine through the years. When she wasn't hostessing social events on her husband's behalf, Anne spent her time with Roy, raising him with limitless love and motherly devotion.<br><br>If she felt any bitterness about the way Burton had treated her, it was because of what he'd done to Roy. Unfortunately, Roy was the one who'd introduced Burton to Aimee. He'd never forgiven himself for that, despite Anne's reassurances. Still, Roy assumed responsibility for what had happened. He couldn't seem to forgive himself for his role in the divorce, no matter how innocent that role had been.<br><br>To complicate the situation even more, he refused to forgive his father, not only for betraying Anne but for stealing Aimee, the woman he himself had loved and planned to marry. Roy's anger was constantly with him. The anger had become part of him, tainting his life, as though he wore smudged, dark glasses that revealed a bleak, drab world. All Roy cared about now was his business, his drive for more and more, and while he'd achieved greater success than most men twice his age, Roy wasn't happy.<br><br>Her son's cynicism troubled Anne deeply&#x2014;even more than the divorce itself. She'd put that behind her, as much as she was able, and built a comfortable life for herself, doing what she loved best&#x2014;painting. Mainly through word of mouth, her work had begun to sell at the local farmers' market and then at a couple of galleries in the area; it now provided her with a small income.<br><br>Anne would've given anything to help her son. Regardless of how much money he made or how many accolades he received, he remained lonely and embittered. She desperately wanted him to find happiness.<br><br>In the five years since the divorce, Roy had not spoken to his father once, despite Burton's repeated efforts. Yet Roy was so like Burton. He shared his father's talents, his ambition. They shared another trait, too, the one that concerned Anne the most. He possessed his father's ability to be ruthless about marriage and relationships. He was thirty-three, and in Anne's view, he should get married. However, her son resolutely refused to discuss it. His attitude toward love and commitment had been completely warped. He no longer dated, no longer sought out relationships.<br><br>The only thing that mattered to Roy was the bottom line. He'd grown cold and uncaring; little outside of Fletcher Industries seemed to affect him. Anne realized her son was in trouble. He was hurting badly, although he seemed incapable of recognizing his own pain. Roy needed someone to teach him the power of forgiveness and love. She'd wanted to be that person, to show him that forgiveness was possible, but in his zeal to succeed, Roy had started to block her out of his life. It was unintentional, she knew, but nonetheless, it hurt.<br><br>Roy had established Fletcher Industries, his own computer security company, in Seattle, shortly after he graduated from college. His innovative, cutting-edge software led the competition in the field. Recent contracts with the government and several banks had given Fletcher Industries a solid position as one of the top companies of its type.<br><br>Those first years after he'd formed his business, Roy spent far too many hours at work. It wasn't uncommon for him to stay in the office for two or three days at a time, living on fast food and catnaps. That all changed after he met Aimee. Her son had fallen in love and he'd fallen hard. Anne had been thrilled and Burton was, too. Then Roy had brought Aimee to his parents' home in Southern California to introduce her... and all their lives had exploded.<br><br>Following his parents' divorce, Roy had quickly reverted to his old habit of working long hours. Only now a callousness had entered into his business dealings. Anne was aware of this, but she was helpless to change her son, and her heart ached with her inability to reach him. Time and again, she'd tried to tell him what he was doing to himself&#x2014;that he was damaging his life and his future&#x2014;but he couldn't or wouldn't hear.<br><br>The kettle whistled, and leaving the Christmas box in the hall, Anne moved into the kitchen. She took the blue ceramic teapot from the cupboard and filled it with boiling water, then added a tea bag&#x2014;Earl Grey, her favorite&#x2014;and left it to steep. After a moment, she poured herself a cup and took a first sip of the aromatic tea. She frowned, berating herself for allowing her thoughts to follow the path they'd taken. Just when she assumed she was free of Burton, she'd wallow in the pain all over again and realize how far she had yet to go. There was only one cure for this bout of self-pity and for the worry that consumed her. Setting down the china cup, Anne bowed her head and prayed. Sometimes it was difficult to find the words to express what was in her heart, but not today. The prayer flew from her lips.<br><br>"Dear Lord, send my son a woman to love. One who'll help him heal, who'll teach him about forgiveness. A woman who'll open his heart and wake him up to the kind of man he's becoming."<br><br>Slowly, as if weighed down by her doubts, Anne's prayer circled the room. Gradually it ascended, rising with the steam from the teapot, spiraling upward out of the simple cottage and toward the leaden sky. It rose higher and higher until it reached the clouds and then sped toward the heavens. There, it landed on the desk of the Archangel Gabriel, the same Archangel who'd delivered the good news of God's love to a humble Jewish maiden more than two thousand years ago.<br><br>Gabriel, however, was away from his desk.<br><br>Shirley, Goodness and Mercy, three Prayer Ambassadors who had a reputation for employing unorthodox means to achieve their ends, stood just inside the Archangel's quarters. Together the three of them watched as the prayer made its way onto his desk. Only the most difficult prayer requests went to the mighty Gabriel&#x2014;the prayers that came from those who were most in need, from the desperate and discouraged.<br><br>"Don't read it," Shirley cried when Goodness, unable to resist, bent to pick up the wispy sheet.<br><br>"Why not?" Goodness had always had more curiosity than was good for her. She knew that peeking at a prayer request before Gabriel had a chance to view it was asking for trouble, but that didn't stop her. Mercy was the one most easily swayed by things on Earth, and Shirley, well, Shirley was nearly perfect. At one time she'd been a Guardian Angel but had transferred to the ranks of the Prayer Ambassadors. That had happened under suspicious circumstances, so Shirley's perfection was a little compromised. Shirley never mentioned the incident, though, and Goodness dared not inquire. She knew that some things were better left unknown&#x2014;despite her desire to hear all the sordid details.<br><br>"Goodness," Shirley warned again.<br><br>"I'm just going to glance at the name," Goodness muttered, carefully lifting the edge of the folded sheet.<br><br>"Is it anyone we know?" Mercy demanded, drawing closer.<br><br>Goodness eyed Shirley, who was trying not to reveal her own interest. "Well, is it?" Shirley finally asked.<br><br>"No," Goodness said. "I've never heard of Anne Fletcher, have you?"<br><br>"Anne Fletcher?" Shirley echoed, and then as if her knees had gone out from under her, she sank into the chair reserved for Gabriel. "Anne Fletcher from California," the former Guardian Angel repeated slowly.<br><br>Goodness looked again, lifting the edge of the sheet just a bit higher this time. "Formerly of California," she said.<br><br>"Oh, no!" Shirley cried. "She moved. I wonder why. Tell me where she's gone."<br><br>"The San Juan Islands," Mercy said, leaning over Goodness to take a look for herself.<br><br>"She's in the Caribbean?" Shirley said, sounding distraught.<br><br>"No, in Puget Sound&#x2014;Washington State," Goodness told her.<br><br>"I remember it well," Mercy said with a dreamy smile. "Don't you remember the Bremerton Shipyard? We had so much fun there."<br><br>"What I remember," Goodness informed her fellow angel, "was all the trouble <em>we </em>got in when <em>you </em>started shifting aircraft carriers and destroyers around."<br><br>"I don't know how many times you want me to apologize for that," Mercy muttered, crossing her arms defiantly. "It was a fluke. Nothing like that's happened since, and frankly I think you're..."<br><br>Her words faded as she saw Goodness studying Shirley. "How do you know Anne Fletcher?" Goodness asked softly.<br><br>"Poor, poor Anne," Shirley murmured, seemingly lost in thought. "I knew her mother&#x2014;I was her Guardian Angel. I was with her mother, Beth, when she gave birth to Anne."<br><br>So Shirley had a connection to Anne Fletcher. "I didn't read the request," Goodness said, more eager than ever to throw caution to the winds and take a second, longer look.<br><br>"Maybe there's something we can do," Mercy said. It sounded as if she was encouraging Goodness to flout protocol, and Goodness was happy to go along with the implied suggestion. She quickly scooped up the prayer request, then almost dropped it when a voice boomed behind them.<br><br>"Do for whom?" it asked.<br><br>Gabriel. The Archangel Gabriel.<br><br>Goodness spun around and backed against the side of the huge desk, crushing her wings in her attempt to hide. Oh, this wasn't good. Gabriel was their friend, but he wouldn't tolerate their snooping around his desk.<br><br>"Nothing." Mercy moved closer to Goodness until they stood shoulder to shoulder, wing to wing.<br><br>Shirley was lost in her own thoughts, sitting in Gabriel's chair, apparently oblivious to their dire circumstances.<br><br>"Do?" Goodness choked out. "Are we supposed to be doing something for someone?"<br><br>"It's Anne Fletcher," Shirley whispered, peering up at Gabriel, apparently still in a stupor. "We've got to help her."<br><br>"Anne Fletcher?" Gabriel's brow furrowed with concern.<br><br>"She's said a prayer for Roy," Goodness explained, and boldly handed Gabriel the request, as much as admitting it had been read. "She <em>wants </em>to believe. But she's worried about her son and has given up hope that anyone can reach him. We can't let her lose faith&#x2014;we just can't!" She gazed up at Gabriel with large, pleading eyes. Her wings were folded back and she hung her head as though she felt the same sense of despair Anne Fletcher did.<br><br>Goodness had never seen Shirley so upset. Clearly this Anne person was someone she cared about.<br><br></p><h2>Victory in Jesus: Embracing His Death and Receiving His Overcoming Life</h2><p>Are you struggling with temptation and sin? Are there things in your life that it seems Christ has been unable to overcome? Are you wondering if victory will ever happen? Are you discouraged, beginning to think you are a lost cause? Is your faith at a low ebb? * Perhaps even you&#39;ve come to the point where you&#39;ve started to believe that you might as well enjoy the sin if you are going to be stuck with it! * Or maybe you just don&#39;t feel that you are measuring up to the high standard of God&#39;s character. The &#34;fruit of the Spirit&#34; - love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control - is not being consistently revealed in your life. If any of this is true in your life, do not despair! There is hope for you! Because every now and then, someone comes along who can preach, teach, or write about salvation and the gospel so clearly - who can make the complex so simple - that it&#39;s as if the doors and windows suddenly fly open all around you, and you see truth as you&#39;ve never seen it before. One such speaker and writer is the author of this heart warming and mind-expanding book. Pastor Liversidge is committed to making the difficult plane - the complicated easy to understand. With liberal use of real-life illustrations, he shines light on the writings of Paul in the book of Romans, making Paul&#39;s theology practical and real. He believes that God wants the way of salvation to be so clear that even a child can understand it. That is Pastor Bill&#39;s goal in every chapter. By the time you finish this practical guide to victory, you&#39;ll no doubt conclude that he has succeeded in that effort. --- from book&#39;s back cover</p><p></p><h2>The Fort at River&#39;s Bend (The Camulod Chronicles, Book 5)</h2><p>After an assassination attempt, Merlyn Britannicus takes his young nephew Arthur to a derelict Roman fort, where he and a group of warrior friends teach the innocent Arthur the skills and responsibilities demanded of a king.

His twenty best-selling books have been enjoyed by more than five million readers.Introduction<br><br>Unveiling Mysteries of the Bible<br><br>Have you ever been puzzled by a mystery in the Bible and you were unable to find anyone who could give you an answer? As a young Christian, I often found myself perplexed by numerous passages in the Scriptures that are difficult to fully understand. I would ask pastors and Bible teachers many questions about these mysteries that fascinated me, including: Where was the Garden of Eden? Where did Cain get his wife? Why do we worship on Sunday? Who were the giants and the sons of God? How can we explain the remarkable miracles during the Exodus? Jesus' virgin birth? The "three days and three nights" and Christ's resurrection? The Star of Bethlehem? The Tower of Babel and the rebuilding of Babylon? I seldom received explanations that satisfied my curiosity.<br><br>As I grew in my Christian faith, I began to acquire a large library of books on archeology, theology, and prophecy that provided some of the answers I sought. Over the last four decades I have accumulated a great deal of information and have studied numerous Bible commentaries that began to unveil these fascinating mysteries.&nbsp;<br><br>This book will explore many of these puzzling passages and offer the best explanation that I have uncovered from personal study. In addition, I have reviewed the works of many of the greatest students of the Word of God. Some of the additional topics covered include: Jonah and the great fish, the darkness at Christ's crucifixion, Joshua's long day, the two genealogies of Jesus, Noah's flood, the lost treasures of the Temple, and the strange account of Saul's encounter with the witch of Endor.&nbsp;<br><br>The Bible is certainly the most mysterious book ever written. From Genesis to Revelation, the Scriptures deal with man's quest for meaning and God's mysterious plan to redeem a spiritually lost humanity through His Son, Jesus Christ. The biblical term "mystery" refers to "a secret of the Lord." However, the mystery is also a secret concerning the Lord Jesus Christ that will be revealed to the faithful who seek His divine wisdom. The apostle Paul refers to this mystery concerning Christ Himself, the very Word of God, "the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ; in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge" (Colossians 2:2-3).&nbsp;<br><br>For thousands of years, countless generations of Jews and Christians have loved the mysterious passages of the Word of God and have sought to understand their true meaning. Early in the 1990s, Bishop William Thomas Manning wrote about the supreme importance of mystery in God's revelation, "Religion with mystery ceases to be religion."<br><br>The Word of God reveals that these hidden mysteries will be revealed to those faithful servants who study its pages. God promises, "The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law" (Deuteronomy 29:29). The wisest man on earth, King Solomon, who asked God for wisdom and understanding, encouraged us to search out the mysteries of God. "It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honor of kings is to search out a matter" (Proverbs 25:2).<br><br>Biblical mysteries challenge our faith as well as our intellect. Tragically, some have lost their faith in the Word of God because they could not find reasonable explanations for many of these mysterious and strange events. While billions of people have placed their complete faith in Jesus Christ and the Word of God, there are millions who have been intellectually and spiritually frustrated by the fact that they have never found a reasonable explanation for some of the mysteries they encountered in the Word of God.<br><br>The illustrations, maps, and photos are placed in many of these chapters to assist you to fully appreciate these remarkable biblical events that have exercised such a compelling power on the minds of people for thousands of years. It is my hope that you will find this book a welcome addition to your home library and that it will be a useful tool in helping you and your family to more fully understand God's wonderful revelation to humanity; the Holy scriptures.<br><br>The final chapter of this book examines the mystery of salvation through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The apostle Paul wrote about the mystery of God's promise of resurrection to eternal life to those who place their faith in Christ's offer of salvation for those who follow Him. "Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the ast trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed" (1 Corinthians 15:51-52). The final mystery is Christ's promise of our resurrection to an eternal life in heaven. Jesus Christ's own resurrection from the grave is proof that all who place their faith in Him will also be resurrected at the last day.&nbsp;<br><br>I encourage you to join me on a voyage of discovery as we unveil some of the most fascinating mysteries of the Bible.</p><h2>The Prophecy of Isaiah: An Introduction &amp; Commentary</h2><p>Presenting a wealth of comment and perspective on Isaiah, J.

Sarris's The American Cinema, the bible of auteur studies, is a history of American film in the form of a lively guide to the work of two hundred film directors, from Griffith, Chaplin, and von Sternberg to Mike Nichols, Stanley Kubrick, and Jerry Lewis. In addition, the book includes a chronology of the most important American films, an alphabetical list of over 6000 films with their directors and years of release, and the seminal essays "Toward a Theory of Film History" and "The Auteur Theory Revisited." Over twenty-five years after its initial publication, The American Cinema remains perhaps the most influential book ever written on the subject.&lt;</p><p>Since its publication in 1968, <i>The American Cinema</i> has been the manifesto of the auteur theory. Written by Andrew Sarris, the theory's chief advocate, the book traces the history of movies by examining the careers of more than 200 film directors. Covering everyone from D.W. Griffith to Francis Coppola, Orson Welles to Roman Polanski, Sarris argues that directorial greatness is marked by a personal style and consistency of excellence that can be traced throughout a career. Sarris's commentary is sometimes worshipful, sometimes acrid, but almost always quotable. Alfred Hitchcock is "the supreme technician of the American cinema." John Huston coasted "on his reputation as a wronged individualist with an alibi for every bad movie." Stanley Kubrick holds "a naive faith in the power of images to transcend fuzzy feelings and vague ideas." Michelangelo Antonioni makes films so pessimistic and alienating that Sarris dubs him "Antoniennui."<p> You may not agree with all of Sarris's assessments, but this book provides the best possible opportunity to consider auteurism, an approach to cinema that, in an age that reveres Scorsese, Spielberg, and Tarantino, seems more relevant than ever. The book closes with an essay called "The Auteur Theory Revised," Sarris's attempt at a definitive theoretical statement. <i>--Raphael Shargel</i></p><b>Andrew Sarris</b> is film critic for the<i>New York Observer</i> and professor of cinema at Columbia University. He is a member of the National Society of Film Critics and the New York Film Critics Circle.

Charming and infuriating, she almost ruins the marriage prospects of Harriet Smith, her prot�g�e, after misguidedly attempting to match Harriet with the local rector, who is in fact in search of a wealthy wife. Reprimanded by her friend, George Knightly, and misled by Frank Crawford, whom she saw as a potential suitor, Emma learns some valuable lessons in humility and about love and marriage.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>What I Learned from God While Quilting</h2><p>From authors Ruth McHaney Danner and Cristine Bolley comes a collection of meditations that quilters, both veterans and novices, will enjoy.

In this major life of a protean figure, the Pulitzer Prizewinning biographer Merlo Pusey tells Meyer&#39;s story, from the hectic Wall street days before World War I when he won and lost- and won fortunes in the development of the copper industry, through his term as a wartime policymaker in Washington, working closely with Bernard Baruch, to the postwar period when he organized the giant Allied Chemical Company and became (for a while simultaneously) governor of the Federal Reserve Board and chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation during the presidency of Herbert HOover, through his emergence as a great newspaper publisher</p><p></p><h2>That Sweet Enemy: The French and the British from the Sun King to the Present</h2><p>A brilliantly original account&#x2014;narrated from both sides&#x2014;of the love-hate relationship between Britain and France that began in the time of Louis XIV and shows no sign of abating.<br><br><i>That Sweet Enemy </i>brings both British wit (Robert Tombs is a British historian) and Gallic panache (Isabelle Tombs is a French historian) to bear on three centuries of the history of Britain and France. The authors take us from Waterloo to Chirac&#x2019;s slandering of British cooking, charting the cross-channel entanglement and its unparalleled breadth of cultural, economic and political influence. They illuminate the complexity of the relationship&#x2014;rivalry, enmity, misapprehension and loathing mixed with envy, admiration and genuine affection&#x2014;and the ways in which it has shaped the modern world, from North America to the Middle East to Southeast Asia, and is still shaping Europe today. They make clear that warfare between the two countries often went hand in hand with hardy, if hidden, strains of anglophilia and francophilia; conversely, though France and Britain were allies for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it has been an alliance almost as uneasy, as competitive and as ambivalent as the previous generations of warfare.<br><br>Wonderfully written&#x2014;acute, witty, consistently surprising&#x2014;<i>That Sweet Enemy</i> is a triumph: an eye-opener for the experts, and a feast for the general reader.</p><p>Robert Tombs was born in England, studied at Cambridge and conducted doctoral research on modern French history in France, where he was connected to the Universit� de Paris IV (Sorbonne).

When the people are . . . weak, cowardly, without discipline, poor, discontented, they are easily subdued; and this is our condition . . . nothing can be added to render them an easy prey to a foreigner unless a sense of their misery and hate of them that cause it make them look on any invader as a deliverer.&#x2014;Algernon Sidney, political writer<br><br>A Nation which hath stood its ground, and kept its privileges and freedoms for Hundreds of Years, is in less than a Third of a Century quite undone; hath lavishly spent above 160 Millions in that time, made Hecatombs of British Lives, stockjobb&#x2019;d (or cannonaded) away its Trade, perverted and then jested away its Honour, Law, and Justice.&#x2014;Political pamphlet, 1719<br>In a Europe devastated by more than a century of ferocious religious conflicts, culminating in a Thirty Years War (1618&#x2013;48) that had killed millions, France, emerging from its own internal conflicts in the 1650s, became the pre-eminent power by reason of its population, armed force, wealth and cultural influence. The embodiment of that power was Louis XIV, who acceded to the throne at the age of four in 1643 and reigned for seventy-two years. Of the fifty-four years when he effectively ruled, thirty-three were years of war. His life was dedicated to ensuring that the king dominated France&#x2014;culturally and politically&#x2014;and that France dominated Europe. This was a time when war and predation were normal conditions. The <i>m�tier de roi</i>&#x2014;the king&#x2019;s job&#x2014;was to direct these conflicts, burnishing his gloire and that of his dynasty and realm, whose prosperity and security were the prizes of his strength and cunning.<br><br>Louis XIV dominated Europe less by force of intellect or character&#x2014;he was hard-working rather than brilliant&#x2014;than by the length of his reign and his tireless devotion to promoting an image of majesty. Artists, writers, architects, musicians and priests were enrolled, to create (as Louis himself wrote) &#x201c;an extremely useful impression of magnificence, power, wealth and grandeur.&#x201d; Versailles, practically complete by 1688, provided a setting that impressed all Europe. It has long been believed&#x2014;and Louis&#x2019;s own comments lend support&#x2014;that his motivation was a reckless thirst for glory. This is not wholly false, but <i>la gloire</i> must be understood to include overtones of &#x201c;renown,&#x201d; even &#x201c;duty.&#x201d; Unlike some British historians, French historians argue that France under Louis was following no grand strategy, whether to seize the Spanish Empire or to gain territory up to what would later be claimed as France&#x2019;s &#x201c;natural frontiers&#x201d;&#x2014;the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Rhine. He and his entourage certainly believed in his right as Europe&#x2019;s greatest monarch to aggrandize his kingdom and dynasty, and to equal or surpass the great men of history&#x2014;he was hailed as an &#x201c;Augustus,&#x201d; a &#x201c;new Constantine&#x201d; or &#x201c;new Charlemagne.&#x201d; These vague and potentially unlimited ambitions, manifested in imperious words and belligerent acts, rallied most of Europe against him. That Britain was dragged into this maelstrom was Louis&#x2019;s part in British history. That, against the odds, Britain came to lead the coalition against Louis was its part in his. His personal support of the Stuarts&#x2014;part chivalry, part piety, part <i>Realpolitik</i>&#x2014;caused durable bitterness within and between the Three Kingdoms, and made conflict with France inevitable.<br><br>By the early 1680s Louis and his ministers could contemplate Europe with satisfaction.<br><br>France . . . is naturally fortified against foreign attack, being almost surrounded by seas, by high mountains, or by very deep rivers. She produces an abundance of the things needed for man . . . She has an unusual perfection as a state . . . and her inhabitants are almost infinite in number, robust and generous, born for war, frank and disciplined.<br>The largest population in Europe&#x2014;20 million and rising&#x2014;made France a giant among pygmies. Spain had only 8.5 million; the countless city states, bishoprics and principalities of Germany totalled 12 million, but with a mosaic of vulnerable micro-states on France&#x2019;s eastern marchlands; the United Provinces of the Netherlands, nearly 2 million; the Scandinavian kingdoms, between 2 and 3 million combined. Well down the pecking order came the &#x201c;Three Kingdoms,&#x201d; with a total population of 8 million and falling, and reckoned by the French foreign ministry to constitute Europe&#x2019;s sixth-ranking power, their government revenues one-fifth those of France, their armies a quarter the size of Sweden&#x2019;s.<br><br>France&#x2019;s natural strength was consolidated by hard labour. In the 1670s the great minister Colbert had built a larger navy than the Dutch or the English. The army, over 200,000 strong, dwarfed all others. The engineer Marshal Vauban built a vast ring of fortresses, which made the kingdom a protected space and, as can be seen from the many still standing, the most fortified country in the world, able to fight nearly all its wars on foreign soil. Nature and labour were seemingly confirmed by Divine Providence, which favoured France in war and diplomacy, bountifully creating a power vacuum into which Louis had stepped. The old Habsburg enemy, which had once ruled both the Spanish and the Holy Roman empires, was now divided between Madrid and Vienna. Spain, though its colonies were temptingly rich, was in decline. The Empire, fragmented and ravaged by war and religious conflict, was assailed by the Turks, who in 1683 were besieging Vienna. Louis seemed to represent the future: absolute royal authority, professional administration, and religious uniformity. French officials and pamphleteers became accustomed to describing any state that opposed them as &#x201c;arrogant&#x201d; and &#x201c;pretentious,&#x201d; so rightful did their superiority appear.<br><br>The Three Kingdoms, after the restoration of their Euro-Scottish dynasty the Stuarts in 1660, had gravitated towards the Bourbon sun. They had not fully emerged from their own share of the religious and military cataclysm that had sundered Europe, and which had cost Charles I his head and 250,000 of his English and Scottish subjects, and an incalculable number of Irish, their lives.6 The return of Charles II from French exile had been popular at first, after the Puritan republic of &#x201c;Fanatics&#x201d; (as their enemies commonly called them). Charles and his brother James, Duke of York, worked to consolidate their restoration by moving towards a modern absolutist regime, bypassing the archaic nuisance of Parliament. This needed French support, including grants of money, sometimes delivered personally to Charles by his valet.7 The French were concerned by England&#x2019;s budding commercial and naval success, and wanted an ally on the British thrones. Charles&#x2019;s senior mistress, Louise de Penancou�t de K�roualle, Duchess of Portsmouth, was a useful agent of influence: the French expatriate writer Saint-Evremond suggested that &#x201c;the silk ribbon round her waist holds France and England together.&#x201d; Charles did not need such pleasurable inducements: his &#x201c;mental map of Europe had its centre not in England at all, but France.&#x201d;8 He helped to start Louis&#x2019;s aggressive war in 1672 against the Dutch, England&#x2019;s national enemy. But this war, far from cementing an Anglo-French alliance, seemed sudden proof that the real threat came from France. The French army was alarmingly successful, while their navy was believed to have deliberately shirked battle so that the British and Dutch would destroy each other. French sailors reportedly &#x201c;bragged that after they had Holland, they hoped to have England.&#x201d;9 English opinion felt they had been duped into serving Louis&#x2019;s aggressive designs, with the connivance of a francophile court. As one MP put it, &#x201c;Our main business is to keep France out of England.&#x201d;10 Charles assured Louis that he was &#x201c;standing up for the interests of France against his whole kingdom.&#x201d;11 Astonishingly, Louis revealed the details of his dealings with Charles to the parliamentary opposition&#x2014; which he was also bribing. His strategy (he acted similarly in Holland) was to stir the embers of the Civil War in order to keep the Three Kingdoms weak.<br><br>Many at home and abroad assumed that the Stuarts&#x2019; power depended on the support of Versailles. Ironically, given his eventual fate, James II of England and VII of Scotland (who succeeded Charles in 1685) moved somewhat out of the French orbit, realizing that Louis would sacrifice the Stuarts if it suited him. Although he appointed a French crony, the Marquis de Blanquefort, alias Earl of Feversham (whose brother commanded the French army in 1688), to command his new mercenary army, raised for internal use, and sent an Irish Catholic with a French title, the Marquis d&#x2019;Albeville, to represent him at the crucial post of The Hague, he did not intend to become wholly dependent, like his brother, on France. His strategy was to avoid expensive European wars while using sea power to counter the French in North America, consolidating his possessions there into a vast private domain&#x2014;New York already belonged to him&#x2014;and using the income to become independent of his parliaments. Those of Scotland and Ireland could be ignored, and that of England subverted.<br><br>Religion was crucial. The struggle that had convulsed Europe since Luther and Calvin was tilting towards a victory for Catholicism, and hence, so many thought, for monarchs. Louis XIV considered Catholicism the pillar of his power, as well as the source of divine favour. Pressure on France&#x2019;s remaining 1.5 million Protestants mounted during the 1680s, ending the relative tolerance that had previously cau...</p><h2>The Lost Heart of Asia</h2><p>Covering the vast miles between the ruined caravan cities of Turmenia to the beautiful and treacherous Pamir and Tien Shan mountains, a portrait of China explores its oppressed past, recent liberation, and hopeful future. National ad/promo.</p><p>West of China, south of Russia, hemmed in by mountains, steppe, and desert, lie the five Central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union. Cut loose from Moscow in the early '90s, the five "Stans" (Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan) discover that their newly found freedom plays tug-o-war with despair and a nostalgia for the certainties of the Soviet past. It's during this time that author Colin Thubron travels the width of central Asia, asking questions about the past, present, and future. Not content to simply bounce from place to place, Thubron travels from person to person, uncovering their many vibrant stories and developing a deep understanding of the area's lesser-known history. Kyrgyz and Uzbeks debate the place of Islam. Koreans and Germans, descendants from forced migrants, wonder if they know enough of their ethnic tongue to return to their homelands. Russians find themselves left behind, disbelieving, as the tide of Russian power recedes toward Moscow. <p> Central Asia was mostly off limits to foreigners during the Soviet years, and while officials are still uncertain about how to deal with a backpack-wearing solo traveler, the locals Thubron meets are not. Thubron finds the heart of Asia in the hearts of its people, swimming in a sea of tea, vodka, and hospitality. From the oldest-known Quran to a deserted Soviet naval base on the shores of a high mountain lake 1,500 miles from the ocean (used to test torpedoes far from spying eyes), Thubron's writing echoes the melancholy emptiness of the wide spaces he passes through. <i> The Lost Heart of Asia</i> is a rare meeting of a marvelous writer and a mysterious land. <i>--Ken Peavler</i></p>A travel book on the newly-emergent countries of central Asia which contain the magical cities of Bukhara and Samarkand, the Kazakh Steppes, the deserts of Karakum and the Pamir Mountains.</p><h2>Conan The Defiant</h2><p>Before avenging a friend&#39;s death, the youthful Conan must battle undead warriors and Men With No Eyes--two formidable factions seeking the Source of Light, a talisman that can make Neg the Malefic unconquerable or destroy him forever</p><p></p><h2>Scorpia Rising (Alex Rider)</h2><p>Scorpia has dogged Alex Rider for most of his life. They killed his parents, they did their best to con Alex into turning traitor, and they just keep coming back with more power. Now the world's most dangerous terrorist organization is playing with fire in the world's most combustible land: the Middle East. No one knows Scorpia like Alex. And no one knows how best to get to Alex like Scorpia. Until now.<br><br> The chases have never been more intense, the fights more treacherous, or the risks so perilous to mankind. And this time, Alex won't get away.</p><p>Anthony Horowitz's life might have been copied from the pages of Charles Dickens or the Brothers Grimm. Born in 1956 in Stanmore, Middlesex, to a family of wealth and status, Anthony was raised by nannies, surrounded by servants and chauffeurs. His father, a wealthy businessman, was, says Mr. Horowitz, "a fixer for Harold Wilson." What that means exactly is unclear &#x2014; "My father was a very secretive man," he says&#x2014; so an aura of suspicion and mystery surrounds both the word and the man. As unlikely as it might seem, Anthony's father, threatened with bankruptcy, withdrew all of his money from Swiss bank accounts in Zurich and deposited it in another account under a false name and then promptly died. His mother searched unsuccessfully for years in attempt to find the money, but it was never found. That too shaped Anthony's view of things. Today he says, "I think the only thing to do with money is spend it." His mother, whom he adored, eccentrically gave him a human skull for his 13th birthday. His grandmother, another Dickensian character, was mean-spirited and malevolent, a destructive force in his life. She was, he says, "a truly evil person", his first and worst arch villain. "My sister and I danced on her grave when she died," he now recalls.<p>A miserably unhappy and overweight child, Anthony had nowhere to turn for solace. "Family meals," he recalls, "had calories running into the thousands.... I was an astoundingly large, round child...." At the age of eight he was sent off to boarding school, a standard practice of the times and class in which he was raised. While being away from home came as an enormous relief, the school itself, Orley Farm, was a <i>grand guignol</i> horror with a headmaster who flogged the boys till they bled. "Once the headmaster told me to stand up in assembly and in front of the whole school said, 'This boy is so stupid he will not be coming to Christmas games tomorrow.' I have never totally recovered." To relieve his misery and that of the other boys, he not unsurprisingly made up tales of astounding revenge and retribution.</p><p>So how did an unhappy boy, from a privileged background, metamorphose into the creator of Alex Rider, fourteen-year-old spy for Britain's MI6? Although his childhood permanently damaged him, it also gave him a gift &#x2014; it provided him with rich source material for his writing career. He found solace in boyhood in the escapism of the James Bond films, he says. He claims that his two sons now watch the James Bond films with the same tremendous enjoyment he did at their age. Bond's glamour translates perfectly to the 14-year-old psyche, the author says. "Bond had his cocktails, the car and the clothes. Kids are just as picky. It's got to be the right Nike trainers (sneakers), the right skateboard. And I genuinely think that 14-year-olds are the coolest people on the planet. It's this wonderful, golden age, just on the cusp of manhood when everything seems possible."</p><p>Alex Rider is unwillingly recruited at the age of fourteen to spy for the British secret service, MI6. Forced into situations that most average adults would find terrifying and probably fatal, young Alex rarely loses his cool although at times he doubts his own courage. Using his intelligence and creativity, and aided by non-lethal gadgets dreamed up by MI6's delightfully eccentric, overweight and disheveled Smithers, Alex is able to extricate himself from situations when all seems completely lost. What is perhaps more terrifying than the deeply dangerous missions he finds himself engaged in, is the attitude of his handlers at MI6, who view the boy as nothing more than an expendable asset.</p><p>The highly successful Alex Rider novels include <i>Stormbreaker</i>, <i>Point Blank</i>, <i>Skeleton Key</i>, and the recent <i>Eagle Strike</i>.</p><p>Anthony Horowitz is perhaps the busiest writer in England. He has been writing since the age of eight, and professionally since the age of twenty. He writes in a comfortable shed in his garden for up to ten hours per day. In addition to the highly successful Alex Rider books, he has also written episodes of several popular TV crime series, including <i>Poirot, Murder in Mind, Midsomer Murders and Murder Most Horrid</i>. He has written a television series <i>Foyle's Wa</i>r, which recently aired in the United States, and he has written the libretto of a Broadway musical adapted from Dr. Seuss's book, <i>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.</i> His film script <i>The Gathering</i> has just finished production. And...oh yes...there are more Alex Rider novels in the works. Anthony has also written the <i>Diamond Brothers</i> series.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Under The Skin (Canons)</h2><p><p><b>With an introduction by David Mitchell</b></p><p>Isserley spends most of her time driving. But why is she so interested in picking up hitchhikers? And why are they always male, well-built and alone?</p><p>An utterly unpredictable and macabre mystery, <i>Under the Skin </i>is a genre-defying masterpiece.</p></p><p>In the opening pages of <i>Under the Skin</i>, a lone female is scouting the Scottish Highlands in search of well-proportioned men: "Isserley always drove straight past a hitch-hiker when she first saw him, to give herself time to size him up. She was looking for big muscles: a hunk on legs. Puny, scrawny specimens were no use to her." At this point, the reader might be forgiven for anticipating some run-of-the-mill psychosexual drama. But commonplace expectation is no help when it comes to Michel Faber's strange and unsettling first novel; small details, then major clues, suggest that something deeply bizarre is afoot. What are the reasons for Isserley's extensive surgical scarring, her thick glasses, her excruciating backache? Who are the solitary few who work on the farm where her cottage is located? And why are they all nervous about the arrival of someone called Amlis Vess? <p> The ensuing narrative is of such cumulative, compelling strangeness that it almost defies description. The one thing that can be said with certainty is that <i>Under the Skin</i> is unlike anything else you have ever read. Faber's control of his medium is nearly flawless. Applying the rules of psychological realism to a fictional world that is both terrifying and unearthly, he nonetheless compels the reader's absolute identification with Isserley. Not even the author's fine short-story collection, <i>Some Rain Must Fall</i>, prepared us for such mastery. <i>Under the Skin</i> is ultimately a reviewer's nightmare and a reader's dream: a book so distinctive, so elegantly written, and so original that one can only urge everybody in earshot to experience it, and soon. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>Now a Major Motion Picture "Alternately gorgeous and terrifying, lyrical and brutal, "Under the Skin "compels and teases . . . Satisfying and successful." "Newsday"In this haunting, entrancing novel, Michel Faber introduces us to Isserley, a female driver who cruises the Scottish Highlands picking up hitchhikers. Scarred and awkward, yet strangely erotic and threatening, she listens to her hitchhikers as they open up to her, revealing clues about who might miss them if they should disappear. A grotesque and comical allegory, "Under the Skin" takes us on a heart-thumping ride through dangerous territory our own moral instincts and the boundaries of compassion to present a surreal representation of contemporary society run amok."A wonderful book painful, lyrical, frightening, brilliant . . . I couldn t put it down." Kate Atkinson, author of "Life After Life"Finalist for the Whitbread AwardMichel Faber is the author of "The Crimson Petal and the White, The Courage Consort, "and "Some Rain Must Fall."

James is one of the leading Marxist interpreters of colonialism and anti-colonial struggle in the 20th century. Famous for his literary and cultural, as well as theoretical, writings, his thinking engaged with a vast range of issues including civil rights, race, class, socialism, cricket, and cultural production. Notes on Dialectics, first publsihed in 1948, is his key theoretical work. It os one of the most complex and original Marxist documents ever to come out of the U.S., where James lived for 15 years. It provides a thorough reexamination of of the Hegelian foundations of Marxist theory and a new interpretation of the history of thelabor movement through a close engagement with Hegel's Logic.&nbsp;To this day, the book represents a brilliant example of a living, productive engagement with Marxist theory and politics.

This all new deluxe edition collects the entire series in a beautiful hardcover edition.<br><br>Collects THE FILTH #1-13.</p><p>Grant Morrison has been working with DC Comics for more than twenty years, beginning with his legendary runs on the revolutionary titles ANIMAL MAN and DOOM PATROL. Since then he has written numerous best-sellers &#x2014; including JLA, BATMAN and <i>New X-Men</i> &#x2014; as well as the critically acclaimed creator-owned series THE INVISIBLES, SEAGUY, THE FILTH, WE3 and JOE THE BARBARIAN. Morrison has also expanded the borders of the DC Universe in the award-winning pages of SEVEN SOLDIERS, ALL-STAR SUPERMAN, FINAL CRISIS and BATMAN, INC., and he is currently reinventing the Man of Steel in the all-new ACTION COMICS.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his secret identity, Morrison is a &#x201c;counterculture&#x201d; spokesperson, a musician, an award-winning playwright and a chaos magician. He is also the author of the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller <i>Supergods</i>, a groundbreaking psycho-historic mapping of the superhero as a cultural organism. He divides his time between his homes in Los Angeles and Scotland.The mutant child of Alan Moore, Terence McKenna and Robert Anton Wilson, Morrison has emerged as one of only a handful of comics writers with a true voice and vision. He's as fascinated by paranoid conspiracy theories and the Kabbalah as he is by superhero archetypes. They're all played out in this psychedelic science fiction adventure. Like his best-known works <i>The Invisibles </i>and <i>Doom Patrol</i>, this story follows a subterranean organization with terrifying science at its disposal&#x2014;but in a break from Morrison's previous works, covert government agency the Hand is actually working to maintain the status quo against the mass hallucinations of a society that needs to dream. The story follows Greg Feely, a balding, middle-aged man who wants nothing more than to look at porn and care for his sick cat. It soon emerges that Feely is actually Ned Slade, special negotiator for the Hand. As Feely/Slade tries to decide which personality he really is, he takes on such twisted entities as deviant superman Spartacus Hughes; Anders Klimakks, a porn star with black semen and irresistible pheromones; the <i>Libertania</i>, a giant ocean liner that's its own country; and Dmitri, a deadly communist monkey assassin. Artistic collaborators Weston and Erskine capture this insanity with razor-sharp precision, dead-on characterizations and such memorable vistas as a decaying miniature world and planets covered with machines. <i>The Filth </i>isn't always entirely coherent, but for sheer audacity and density of ideas, it will stand up to many readings. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The farmers in this case are a vaguely criminal team of three stooges: "Boggis and Bunce and Bean / One fat, one short, one lean. / These horrible crooks / So different in looks / Were nonetheless equally mean." Whatever their prowess as poultry farmers, within these pages their sole objective is the extermination of our hero--the noble, the clever, the Fantastic Mr. Fox. Our loyalties are defined from the start; after all, how could you cheer for a man named Bunce who eats his doughnuts stuffed with mashed goose livers? As one might expect, the farmers in this story come out smelling like ... well, what farmers occasionally do smell like.<p> This early Roald Dahl adventure is great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds, who will be delighted to hear that Mr. Fox keeps his family one step ahead of the obsessed farmers. When they try to dig him out, he digs faster; when they lay siege to his den, he tunnels to where the farmers least expect him--their own larders! In the end, Mr. Fox not only survives, but also helps the whole community of burrowing creatures live happily ever after. With his usual flourish, Dahl evokes a magical animal world that, as children, we always knew existed, had we only known where or how to look for it. <i>(Great read aloud for any age; written at a 9- to 12-year-old reading level)</i></p>Fantastic Mr. Fox is on the run! The three meanest farmers around are out to get him. Fat Boggis, squat Bunce, and skinny Bean have joined forces, and they have Mr. Fox and his family surrounded. What they don?t know is that they?re not dealing with just any fox?Mr. Fox would never surrender. But only the most fantastic plan ever can save him now.</p><h2>Corruption and the Decline of Rome</h2><p>Prominent historian Ramsay MacMullen here offers a new perspective on the decline and fall of Rome.

It is based on the classic romantic horror story set in the Paris Opera House in which a masked musician, living in the dark recesses of the vast building, commits murder in order to further the career of a young soprano with whom he is besotted. This lavishly illustrated, definitive account traces the origins of the Phantom in truth and legend. Author George Perry relates how the novelist Gaston Leroux, on visiting the Opera House under construction, was so intrigued by the chilling atmosphere that he felt compelled to write what was to become a masterpiece of its day, the novel, &#34;The Phantom of the Opera&#34;. Using archive illustrations, many previously unpublished, the secret areas of the Opera House that fired Leroux&#39;s imagination, are here revealed. In the triumphant staging of &#34;The Phantom of the Opera&#34;, in London and on Broadway, Andrew Lloyd Webber has developed the original story and previous interpretations into the ultimate theatrical experience. Through interviews with the main protagonists, George Perry sheds light on the complex production machinery of such a show, and pays tribute to the professionalism and creativity of the many people who have contributed to its remarkable success. The book includes the complete libretto and many colour photographs of the stage production, which have been especially commissioned.</p><p>Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s Phantom is based on the classic story set in the Paris Opera House in which a masked musician, living in the dark recesses of the vast building, commits murder to further the career of a young soprano with whom he is besotted.

Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, grew out of a 1997 <i>Time</i> magazine cover story called "Mormon's Inc." One of the reporters on that story, Richard Ostling, became so fascinated by Mormonism that he set out to write "a candid but non-polemical" overview of the Church, beginning with its founding by Joseph Smith Jr. in 1830 and continuing to the present day. The resulting book is a marvel of clarity, organization, and analysis. <p> For statistical reasons alone, the Mormon Church demands a reader's attention: in just 170 years, the Church has grown from six members to more than 10 million; if current rates of growth continue, membership could hit 265 million by 2080, which would make it the most important world religion to emerge since the rise of Islam. <i>Mormon America</i> clarifies the reasons for the religion's rapid growth: "It was from the beginning optimistic and upbeat, a reaction against the establishment New England Calvinism.... It was a religious version of the American dream: Everyman presented with unlimited potential." The book also investigates the Mormons' immense wealth (relative to size, this is "America's richest church, with an estimated $30 billion in assets and something like $6 billion in annual income, mostly from members' tithes.") It anatomizes the minutiae of Church governance (Mormonism is ruled by a self-perpetuating, all-male hierarchy, headed by a "President, Prophet, Seer, and Revelator"), details the many rules that govern the Mormon lifestyle (famously, they avoid caffeine and alcohol; the Church's mandates extend even to the proper technique for "dispos[ing] of worn-out holy underwear"), and summarizes the Mormon scriptures. <i>Mormon America</i> is a compulsively readable book, not only for its insightful analysis and wealth of factual information, but also, and most importantly, because it respects its subject rigorously. "This is a real faith," the Ostlings write, "and must be understood in those terms, without caricature." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p><p>Richard N.

Oxnam, the successful China scholar and president of the Asia Society, faced up to what he thought was his biggest personal challenge: alcoholism. But this dependency masked a problem far more serious: Multiple Personality Disorder.At the peak of his professional career, after having led the Asia Society for nearly a decade, Oxnam was haunted by periodic blackouts and episodic rages. After his family and friends intervened, Oxnam received help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Jeffrey Smith, and entered a rehab center. It wasn+t until 1990 during a session with Dr. Smith that the first of Oxnam+s eleven alternate personalities-an angry young boy named Tommy-suddenly emerged. With Dr. Smith+s help, Oxnam began the exhausting and fascinating process of uncovering his many personalities and the childhood trauma that caused his condition. This is the powerful and moving story of one person+s struggle with this terrifying illness. The book includes an epilogue by Dr. Smith in which he describes Robert+s case, the treatment, and the nature of multiple personality disorder. Robert+s courage in facing his situation and overcoming his painful past makes for a dramatic and inspiring book.</p><p>Robert B. Oxnam is internationally recognized as an outstanding Asia specialist and dynamic speaker. He often accompanies prominent Americans--such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush--as they seek in-depth, firsthand knowledge of China. For more than a decade he was president of the Asia Society, which has headquarters in New York, across the United States, and throughout the Asia-Pacific region. He has hosted MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour specials on Asia. He lives in New York with his wife, Vishakha Desai.*Starred Review* Sybil, of course, and a handful of others have achieved a measure of public recognition as a result of books chronicling their lives with MPD--multiple personality disorder, known in clinical circles as DID, dissociative identity disorder. Unlike the others, Asia specialist and public speaker Oxnam achieved public distinction, to say nothing of an impressive list of professional accomplishments, despite the at-times crippling burden of MPD, manifested by no fewer than 10 additional, distinct personalities, or "alters," of himself. Sometimes he was in charge; sometimes not. He was often relegated to the role of hapless passenger as one or another alter drove all of them down a path of profligate eating and drinking, temper tantrums, or adultery. Oxnam doesn't shirk responsibility, but with a father who tolerated nothing short of scholastic, indeed overall, perfection and a drama-queen mother, it seems inevitable that Oxnam developed some sort of mental instability. But add gross physical and sexual abuse at the hands of trusted family members into the mixture of childhood experiences, and there is little remarkable in the fact that this child's mind broke into the walled divisions within what the adult Oxnam calls the Castle, home to his inner selves. A remarkable life that, for all its successes, took great personal courage to survive and to publicly record. <i>Donna Chavez</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now a new generation of brilliant, outspoken women of color is speaking to the concerns of a new feminism, and to their place in it. Daisy Hernandez of Ms. magazine and poet Bushra Rehman have collected a diverse, lively group of emerging writers who speak to their experience to the strength and rigidity of community and religion, to borders and divisions, both internal and external and address issues that take feminism into the twenty-first century. One writer describes herself as a mixed brown girl, Sri-Lankan and New England mill-town white trash,&#x201d; and clearly delineates the organizing differences between whites and women of color: We do not kick ass the way the white girls do, in meetings of NOW or riot grrl. For us, it&#x2019;s all about family.&#x201d; A Korean-American woman struggles to create her own identity in a traditional community: Yam-ja-neh means nice, sweet, compliant. I&#x2019;ve heard it used many times by my parents&#x2019; friends who don&#x2019;t know shit about me.&#x201d; An Arab-American feminist deconstructs the quaint vision&#x201d; of Middle-Eastern women with which most Americans feel comfortable. This impressive array of first-person accounts adds a much-needed fresh dimension to the ongoing dialogue between race and gender, and gives voice to the women who are creating and shaping the feminism of the future.</p><p>Bushra Rehman's novel <i>Corona</i> was included in <i>Poets &amp; Writers </i>Best Debut Fiction list and featured in the <i>LA Review of Books</i>. Her work has been featured in <i>The New York Times, Color Lines, Poets and Writers, The Feminist Wire,</i> and more.<br><br> Daisy Hern�ndez is the author of <i>A Cup of Water Under My Bed</i> and the former editor of <i>ColorLines</i>. She has written for <i>The Atlantic, The New York Times</i>, and NPR's All Things Considered. She teaches creative writing at Miami University in Ohio.<br><br>Ms. magazine columnist Hernandez and former Muslim poet Rehman, both feminist activists, have assembled a broad collection of essays by young women writers, academics, and activists from a range of cultures and sexual orientations. A few essays have a very specialized focus, describing such experiences as a Chicana with HIV and a Native American woman participating in the typically male War Dance ceremony. More often the contributors look more generally at their lives and families and consider how these experiences have influenced their understanding of feminism. Several writers critique "white, middle class feminism" for failing to take into account the impact of classism and racism on women of color. One essay discusses the impact of gentrification on poor, single mothers; another tells of the author's immigrant mother turning to sex work to support her daughters. Cultural and religious customs are discussed by a Nigerian woman who comes to the United States for college and by an Indian American woman who is expected to pursue an arranged marriage. These are very personal, interesting, and readable essays. Recommended for large public and academic libraries.

Kotter is the Konosuke Matsushita Professor of Leadership at the Harvard Business School. His most recent book is <i>A Force for Change,</i> (Free Press).<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>The Power of Culture</b> </p><p> We encounter organizational cultures all the time. When they are not our own, their most visible and unusual qualities seem striking: the look of the traditionally dressed IBM salesman, the commitment to firm and product expressed by employees at Honda or Matsushita, the informality of Apple and many other high-tech companies. When the cultures are our own, they often go unnoticed -- until we try to implement a new strategy or program which is incompatible with their central norms and values. Then we observe, first hand, the power of culture. <br> </p><p> The term "culture" originally comes from social anthropology. Late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century studies of "primitive" societies -- Eskimo, South Sea, African, Native American -- revealed ways of life that were not only different from the more technologically advanced parts of America and Europe but were often very different among themselves. The concept of culture was thus coined to represent, in a very broad and holistic sense, the qualities of any specific human group that are passed from one generation to the next. The <i>American Heritage Dictionary</i> defines "culture," more formally, as "the totality of socially transmitted behavior patterns, arts, beliefs, institutions, and all other products of human work and thought characteristics of a community or population." </p><p> We have found it helpful to think of <i>organizational</i> culture as having two levels, which differ in terms of their visibility and their resistance to change. At the deeper and less visible level, culture refers to values that are shared by the people in a group and that tend to persist over time even when group membership changes. These notions about what is important in life can vary greatly in different companies; in some settings people care deeply about money, in others about technological innovation or employee well-being. At this level culture can be extremely difficult to change, in part because group members are often unaware of many of the values that bind them together. </p><p> At the more visible level, culture represents the behavior patterns or style of an organization that new employees are automatically encouraged to follow by their fellow employees. We say, for example, that people in one group have for years been "hard workers," those in another are "very friendly" to strangers, and those in a third always wear very conservative clothes. Culture, in this sense, is still tough to change, but not nearly as difficult as at the level of basic values. </p><p> Each level of culture has a natural tendency to influence the other. This is perhaps most obvious in terms of shared values influencing a group's behavior -- a commitment to customers, for example, influencing how quickly individuals tend to respond to customer complaints. But causality can flow in the other direction too -- behavior and practices can influence values. When employees who have never had any contact with the marketplace begin to interact with customers and their problems and needs, they often begin to value the interests of customers more highly. </p><p> Conceptualized in this way, culture in a business enterprise is not the same as a firm's "strategy" or "structure," although these terms (and others such as "vision" or "mission") are sometimes used almost interchangeably because they can all play an important part, along with the competitive and regulatory environment, in shaping people's behavior (see exhibit 1.2). Strategy is simply a logic for how to achieve movement in some direction. The beliefs and practices called for in a strategy may be compatible with a firm's culture or they may not. When they are not, a company usually finds it difficult to implement the strategy successfully. But even when successfully implemented, the behavior patterns that represent a given strategy are not cultural <i>unless</i> most group members tend actively to encourage new members to follow those practices. </p><p> Structure refers to certain formal organizational arrangements. Such arrangements may call for behavior that is already pervasive in a firm for cultural reasons. They may call for actions that are not in the culture but are in no way incompatible with it. Or they may call for practices that are at odds with the culture. In this last case, we often find that people differentiate the "formal organization" from the "informal organization." </p><p> Although we usually talk about organizational culture in the singular, all firms have multiple cultures -- usually associated with different functional groupings or geographic locations. Even within a relatively small subunit, there may be multiple and even conflicting subcultures. Large and geographically dispersed organizations might have hundreds of different cultures. When people talk of "the corporate culture," they usually mean values and practices that are shared across all groups in a firm, at least within senior management. Using the same logic, a "divisional culture" would be the culture that is shared by all the functional and geographical groups in a division of a corporation. </p><p> Firms have cultures because the conditions needed for their creation are commonplace. As MIT's Edgar Schein and others have well demonstrated, all that seems to be required is that a group of employees interact over a significant period of time and be relatively successful at whatever they undertake. Solutions that repeatedly appear to solve the problems they encounter tend to become a part of their culture. The longer the solutions seem to work, the more deeply they tend to become embedded in the culture. Thus, if management increases advertising expenditures whenever revenues cease to grow and that action always appears to increase sales significantly, this behavioral pattern will likely become a part of the firm's corporate culture. Depending upon the specific circumstances, a related value or belief -- perhaps "Ads are great in a downturn," or "Selective advertising is valuable" -- may also become a part of that culture. </p><p> Ideas or solutions that become embedded in a culture can originate anywhere: from an individual or a group, at the bottom of the organization or the top. But in firms with strong corporate cultures, these ideas often seem to be associated with a founder or other early leaders who articulate them as a "vision," a "business strategy," a "philosophy," or all three. </p><p> Once established, organizational cultures often perpetuate themselves in a number of ways. Potential group members may be screened according to how well their values and behavior fit in. Newly selected members may be explicitly taught the group's style. Historical stories or legends may be told again and again to remind everyone of the group's values and what they mean. Managers may explicitly try to act in ways that exemplify the culture and its ideals. Senior members of the group may communicate key values over and over in their daily conversations or through special rituals and ceremonies. People who successfully achieve the ideals inherent in the culture may be recognized and made into heroes. The natural process of identification between younger and older members may encourage the younger members to take on the values and styles of their mentors. Perhaps most fundamental, people who follow cultural norms will be rewarded but those who do not will be penalized. </p><p> Cultures can be very stable over time, but they are never static. Crises sometimes force a group to reevaluate some values or set of practices. New challenges can lead to the creation of new ways of doing things. Turnover of key members, rapid assimilation of new employees, diversification into very different businesses, and geographical expansion can all weaken or change a culture. </p><p> Sufficient crises and turnover, coupled with the lack of perpetuating mechanisms, can destroy a culture or make it very weak. But conversely, cultures can grow to be extremely strong -- where there are many common values, behavior patterns, and practices, and where the levels of culture are tightly interconnected. Continuity of leadership, stable group membership, geographical concentration, small group size, and considerable success all contribute to the emergence of strong cultures. </p><p> Cultures can have powerful consequences, especially when they are strong. They can enable a group to take rapid and coordinated action against a competitor or for a customer. They can also lead intelligent people to walk, in concert, off a cliff. One of the very earliest examples of modern business research concluded that work groups in organizations could develop their own unique cultures and that those cultures could hurt or help a firm's performance. This idea received limited attention outside academia until the late 1970s when an interrelated group of people, most of them associated with a small set of universities and consulting firms (Harvard, Stanford, MIT, McKinsey, and MAC), began asserting the importance of what they called "corporate" or "organizational" culture. Their claims were based mostly on three kinds of research: of Japanese firms that consistently outperformed their American competition; of U.S. firms that were doing well despite the increasingly competitive business environment that began to emerge in the 1970s; and of companies that were trying to develop and implement competitive strategies to cope with that new environment, but were having difficulty doing so. </p><p> In each of these cases, despite differences in initial research focus, terminology, and methodology, the fundamental conclusions were very similar and very dramatic: all firms have corporate cultures, although some have much "stronger" cultures than others; these cultures can exert a powerful effect on individuals and on performance, especially in a competitive environment; this influence may even be greater than all those factors that have been discussed most often in the organizational and business literature -- strategy, organizational structure, management systems, financial analysis tools, leadership, etc.; the very best American and Japanese executives often devote time and energy expressly to creating, shaping, or maintaining strong corporate cultures. </p><p> The first book-length reports of this work received a great deal of attention. After a decade of increasing competitive intensity in most U.S. industries, an environment in which firms did not perform as well as they did in the 1950s and 1960s, many people were looking for new answers and new ideas, and something in these books rang true. Despite somewhat radical, or at least unconventional, conclusions, the four books published in 1981 and 1982 -- Ouchi's <i>Theory Z,</i> Pascale and Athos's <i>The Art of Japanese Management,</i> Deal and Kennedy's <i>Corporate Cultures,</i> and Peters and Waterman's <i>In Search of Excellence -- all</i> became best sellers. <i>In Search of Excellence</i> broke nonfiction book sales records. </p><p> The resulting impact on both management and public opinion was unusually large. In 1989, less than a decade after the term "corporate culture" came into general use, Time, Inc., blocked a hostile bid by Paramount by arguing that its culture would be destroyed or changed by the takeover, to the detriment of its customers, its shareholders, and society. When the chancery judge ruled in Time's favor, he said (in part) "that there may...be instances in which the law might recognize a perceived threat to a 'corporate culture' that is shown to be palpable (for lack of a better word), distinctive, and, advantageous." </p><p> The successes of the first four "culture" books encouraged dozens of additional studies. Some of these subsequent studies offered theories about the relationship of culture and performance that depart radically from those found in the first four. A few scholars have even questioned whether there is any generalizable relationship between culture and performance. This more recent work was also critical of earlier ideas about cultural change. Some people have even questioned whether a firm's management can successfully manipulate a corporate culture, especially since it is difficult to find convincingly documented cases of cultural change. </p><p> It was against this background that we launched our research in 1987. <br> </p><p> Between August 1987 and January 1991, we conducted four studies to determine whether a relationship exists between corporate culture and long-term economic performance, to clarify the nature of and the reasons for such a relationship, and to discover whether and how that relationship can be exploited to enhance a firm's performance. </p><p> Many factors influence the performance of firms. Here, we are interested in the potential impact of one element only -- corporate culture <i>(not</i> subunit cultures). Because of the complexity of the relationships involved and the difficulty of measuring various factors, research of this sort is almost impossible to do with great rigor. Nevertheless, we tried in our four studies to be as systematic and precise as possible. </p><p> Our first inquiry was focused on the largest 9 or 10 firms in twenty-two different U.S. industries. We attempted to test the most widely accepted theory linking corporate culture to long-term economic performance. The results of this work are reported in Chapter 2. In the second study, we tested two more culture/performance theories, this time by examining in more depth a small subset (22) of the original 207 firms. This work is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4; Chapter 5 is a detailed description of one of those cases. The third study examined 20 firms that appear to have had cultures that hurt their economic performance. The results of that inquiry can be found in Chapter 6. Our last project focused on 10 firms that seem to have changed their corporate cultures within the recent past and then benefitted economically. That study is discussed in Chapters 7 and 8; Chapters 9 and 10 are descriptions of two of those ten cases. </p><p> In total, our studies strongly suggest that the early corporate culture books were very much on the right track, although they failed in some important ways -- not unusual in the case of pioneering work. More specifically, our studies show that: </p><p> 1. <i>Corporate culture can have a significant impact on a firm's long-term economic performance.</i> We found that firms with cultures that emphasized all the key managerial constituencies (customers, stockholders, and employees) and leadership from managers at all levels outperformed firms that did not have those cultural traits by a huge margin. Over an eleven-year period, the former increased revenues by an average of 682 percent versus 166 percent for the latter, expanded their work forces by 282 percent versus 36 percent, grew their stock prices by 901 percent versus 74 percent, and improved their net incomes by 756 percent versus 1 percent. </p><p> 2. <i>Corporate culture will probably be an even more important factor in determining the success or failure of firms in the next decade.</i> Performance-degrading cultures have a negative financial impact for a number of reasons, the most significant being their tendency to inhibit firms from adopting needed strategic or tactical changes.

Lori Reid employs color photos for her examples rather than relying on line drawings. This abundance of detailed illustration is an immense help when trying to match theory with reality. Much more than a book on palmistry, <i>The Art of Hand Reading</i> covers all the aspects of reading hands in clear detail, making this the perfect book for beginners, but just as useful for the experienced reader.Has there ever been a better subject for a Dorling Kindersley book? Clearly, the DK approach of melding free-floating illustrations with supportive text is ideally suited to an instructional guide on hand reading--the bigger and clearer the pictures of the hand's life lines, fate lines, etc., the easier it will be to grasp this essentially visual subject. The DK illustrators are up to the challenge, supplying a cornucopia of hands, fingers, and thumbs to illustrate not only the lines on the palm but also the different designs of the hand itself--shape, size of fingers, the hand's overall topography. Sidebars offer a wealth of snappy background information (how to make a handprint, for example). The only weakness here is Reid's text, which too often seems overly simplistic: lots of lines indicate a high-strung personality; few mean a calm nervous system. Now there's a surprise. Still, if it's detailed pictures of hands you're after, DK is the place to go. <i>Ilene Cooper</i></p><h2>Partisans</h2><p>Major Peter Petersen leads an international group of men and women on a dangerous, clandestine operation into Yugoslavia during World War II</p><p>Heroes of amazing strength and resolve, impossible odds, and betrayal where it is least expected are all hallmarks of Alistair MacLean's work.

Reissue.</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)Compiled during the eighth century, the Manyoshu is a sweeping anthology of 4516 poems on a range of subjects from the bawdy to the heroic. Wright, a scholar of Oriental poetry, has drawn from it 136 lyrical love poems written by royalty and peasants, warriors and priests. As he explains in his enlightening introduction, all the love poems were originally written in tanka, a 31-syllable form divided into five units. His translations each contain five lines, with each line comprising the designated number of syllables, except where too rigid a structure would interrupt the flow of a line. The poems are arranged thematically. Many look to nature for an outward, physical expression of mood, emotion, the passing of time. We read about the anticipation of love, the memory of love, and the constancy of love into old age. But by far the most prevalent theme is the longing for lovelonging for a spouse away at war, for a lover, for a person glimpsed but still unknown. Over 30 beautiful black-and-white illustrations accompany the poems. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Palm-of-the-Hand Stories</h2><p>Translated by Lane Dunlop and J. Martin Holman<br><br>Winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968, Yasunari Kawabata is perhaps best known in the United States for his deeply incisive, marvelously lyrical novel <i>Snow Country</i>. But according to Kawabata himself, the essence of his art was to be found in a series of short stories-which he called "Palm-of-the-Hand Stories"-written over the entire span of his career. He began experimenting with the form in 1923 and returned to it often. In fact, his final work was a "palm-sized" reduction of <i>Snow Country</i>, written not long before his suicide in 1972. Dreamlike, intensely atmospheric, at times autobiographical and at others fantastical, these stories reflect Kawabata's abiding interest in the miniature, the wisp of plot reduced to the essential. In them we find loneliness, love, the passage of time, and death. <i>Palm-of-the-Hand Stories</i> captures the astonishing range and complexity of one of the century's greatest literary talents. <br></p><p><b>Yasunari Kawabata </b>was born in Osaka, Japan, in 1899 and before World War II had established himself as his country's leading novelist. After the war he continued to publish major novels, including <i>Thousand Cranes, The Sound of the Mountain, </i>and<i> The Old Capital</i> (North Point, 1987).<br>Nobel laureate Kawabata is best known in the West for such novels as Snow Country and Thousand Cranes, yet his short stories, written over 50 years, seem to contain his essence as a writer. Here sensitively translated are 70 of them, most written in Kawabata's youth and usually no more than a page or two in length, though the last one, "Gleanings from Snow Country," is somewhat longer and was written just before Kawabata's suicide in 1972; it is a miniaturization of the highly praised novel of the same name. The tales are variously realistic, allegorical and fantastic; and, as in the novels, the principal themes are love, loneliness, social change, man's relation with nature and death. Each story exhibits some sharp and often subtle perception of life (in Kawabata's world, stillness can "resound" and men listening to a woman's laugh can experience "a strange kind of aural jealousy"); and each, like a haiku or classic Zen painting, suggests far more than it states. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Prospero Burns (15) (The Horus Heresy)</h2><p>Book fifteen in the New York Times bestselling series<br><br>The Emperor is enraged.

Governor Rulon - a devious but down-home politico - has a special request, one Joe knows he can&#39;t refuse. For weeks, the headlines have been abuzz with the story of Clay McCann, a lawyer who slaughtered four campers in a far-off corner of Yellowstone. After the murders, McCann immediately turned himself in at the nearest ranger station. Seemed like a slam-dunk case for law enforcement - except that the crimes were committed in a thin sliver of land with zero residents and overlapping jurisdiction, the so-called free-fire zone. McCann has taken advantage of an obscure loophole in the law: neither the state nor the federal government can try him for his crime.

Visit his website at www.cjbox.net.*Starred Review* Box set the standards so high with his Joe Pickett series that, once in a while, he's had a hard time getting over the bar himself, as with <i>In Plain Sight</i> (2006), where he just tripped it with his toe. In <i>ree Fire</i>, however, he gets over cleanly. Pickett, having been fired as a game warden, is working as foreman of his father-in-law's ranch when Wyoming's loose-cannon governor, Spencer Rulon, reinstates him--not to work his old district but to investigate, without official support, a crime in Yellowstone National Park. A lawyer has found a legal loophole that allows him to kill four campers and walk away scot-free, enraging Rulon. (A remote, uninhabited part of the park, soon dubbed the "Zone of Death," has murky jurisdiction and no residents to form a jury.) But, sure as Pickett is hard on government vehicles, there's something even more sinister than a twisted legal mind behind the murders. Box is a master at working New West issues into his stories--here it's something called biomining--exploring pro and con arguments without missing a storytelling beat. And, mining series gold, he's forged a perfect alloy of familiar and fresh. Though Joe's far out in no-man's-land, as professionally on his own as he's ever been, the family man's moral compass is as strong as ever. And setting the action in the bubbling Yellowstone caldera--which could blow sky high any minute, we're told--is a masterstroke, lending both urgency and the long view to the proceedings.

Rendered in extraordinarily vivid, honest prose, these stories show Rhys at the height of her literary powers and offer a fascinating counterpoint to her most famous novel, Wide Sargasso Sea. This volume includes all the stories from her three collections,The Left Bank (1927), Tigers Are Better-Looking (1968) and Sleep It Off, Lady (1976).</p><p>Jean Rhys was born in Dominica in 1894. After arriving in England aged sixteen, she became a chorus girl and drifted between different jobs before moving to Paris, where she started to write in the late 1920s. She published a story collection and four novels, after which she disappeared from view and lived reclusively for many years. In 1966 she made a sensational comeback with her masterpiece, Wide Sargasso Sea, written in difficult circumstances over a long period. Rhys died in 1979.Includes some of the best British short stories of the last century ...

This book looks at the politics of our times and the roots of human nature to discover why so many atrocities were perpetuated and how we can create a social environment to prevent their recurrence. Jonathan Glover finds similarities in the psychology of those who perpetuate, collaborate in, and are complicit with atrocities, uncovering some disturbing common elements--tribal hatred, blind adherence to ideology, diminished personal responsibility--as well as characteristics unique to each situation. Acknowledging that human nature has a dark and destructive side, he proposes that we encourage the development of a political and personal moral imagination that will compel us to refrain from and protest all acts of cruelty.</p><p>In <i>Humanity</i>, English ethicist Jonathan Glover begins with the now commonplace observation that the last 100 years were perhaps the most brutal in all history. But the problem wasn't that human nature suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse: "It is a myth that barbarism is unique to the twentieth century: the whole of human history includes wars, massacres, and every kind of torture and cruelty," he writes. Technology has made a huge difference, but psychology has remained the same--and this is what Glover seeks to examine, through discussions of Nietzsche, the My Lai atrocity in Vietnam, Hiroshima, tribal genocide in Rwanda, Stalinism, Nazism, and so&nbsp;on.<p> There is much history here, but <i>Humanity</i> is fundamentally a book of philosophy. In his first chapter, for instance, Glover announces his goal "to replace the thin, mechanical psychology of the Enlightenment with something more complex, something closer to reality." But he also seeks "to defend the Enlightenment hope of a world that is more peaceful and more humane, the hope that by understanding more about ourselves we can do something to create a world with less misery." The result is an odd combination of darkness and light--darkness because the subject matter of the 20th century's moral failings is so bleak, light because of Glover's earnest optimism, which insists that "keeping the past alive may help to prevent atrocities." He cites Stalin's bracing comment, made while signing death warrants: "Who's going to remember all this riff-raff in ten or twenty years' time? No one." At one level, <i>Humanity</i> is a book of remembrance. But it's more than that: it's also an attempt to understand what it is in the human mind that makes moral disaster always loom--and a prayer that this aspect of our psychology might be better controlled. <i>--John&nbsp;J. Miller</i></p>This is an extraordinary book, incisive and far-reaching, that both confronts unpleasant historical facts and offers some hopeful suggestions about what concerned human beings can do about them.&#34;-Martha NussbaumThe twentieth century was the most brutal in human history, featuring a litany of shameful events that includes the Holocaust, Hiroshima, the Stalinist era, Cambodia, Yugoslavia, and Rwanda.

Here is the radical&#x2019;s guide to activist work&#x2014;the manual we need at this crucial moment to organize for universal human rights, a habitable earth, and a more egalitarian society.&nbsp;<br><br> Thoroughly exploring the achievements and failures of radical movements throughout history&#x2014;from 19th-century anti-colonial rebellions in China and the environmental actions of First Nations and Native American tribes throughout the 20th century, to Black Lives Matter and the fight for Gay Liberation&#x2014;the two volumes of <i>Full Spectrum Resistance </i>candidly advocate for direct action, not just risk-averse models of protest marches and call-ins. With in-depth histories and case studies of social justice and environmental movements, noted writer, activist, and farmer Aric McBay explains why passive resistance alone cannot work, and how we must be prepared to do whatever it takes to create substantial social change.&nbsp;<br><br> In <i>Volume 1: Building Movements and Fighting to Win</i>, McBay describes the need for resistance movements, and paints a portrait of what a thriving resistance movement might look like today. Citing successful movements such as the Deacons of Defense of the American Civil Rights Movement, the anti-colonial revolutions in Guinea and Cape Verde, and activist groups like Act-UP, McBay deftly illustrates how to organize activist groups and encourage enlistment, while also noting the necessary precautions one must take to secure these radical circles from infiltration and collapse.</p><p><b>Aric McBay</b>&nbsp;is an organizer, a farmer, and author of four books. He writes and speaks about effective social movements, and has organized campaigns around prison justice, Indigenous solidarity, pipelines, unionization, and other causes. You can find his work at&nbsp;www.aricmcbay.org."Aric McBay begins his newest work <i>Full Spectrum Resistance </i>with the words: 'I wrote this book because we are losing,' and, indeed, he presents a long list of global losses and failures in the realm of the environment, Indigenous sovereignty, women's rights, class struggle, racism and more. However, as McBay melds together meticulous research into resistance movements past and present and a lifetime of activism of many kinds, he paints what is, more than anything, a picture of hope. He notes, near the beginning of volume one that 'we fight because it is right' and, towards the end of volume two that 'we can fight and we can win.' <b>McBay's message of activism and community building is one that should inspire all people concerned about the future of this planet to, in his words: 'fight together for a future worth living in.'</b>" -- Pamela Cross, feminist lawyer and activist<br>"<i>Full Spectrum Resistance</i>&nbsp;is more than a comprehensive guide and&nbsp;a helpful handbook&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a red-hot torch capable of scorching the banal platitudes and old orthodoxies of the Left as it lights a path forward for those whose object is to win. Aric McBay draws hard-earned lessons from decades of activism and organizing, inquiry and study, building and sustaining social movements, winning and (importantly) losing campaigns and battles, and crafts a smart and passionate argument for the gathering resistance. <b>For anyone who understands the urgency of the catastrophe we&#x2019;re facing and is in search of an antidote to despair or resignation, McBay provides a lantern that will cut through the blunt blear and gritty exhaust all around, and offers this sizzling invitation to unleash your most radical imagination, to dive into the wreckage, and to risk winning a humane future.</b>" -- Bill Ayers, founding member of the Weather Underground, author of&nbsp;<i>Fugitive Days, Public Enemy,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Demand the Impossible: A radical manifesto.<br></i>"Aric McBay's&nbsp;<i>Full Spectrum Resistance, Volumes One &amp; Two&nbsp;</i>are&nbsp;must reads for those wanting to know more about social movement theory, strategies and tactics for social change, and the history and politics of activism and community organizing. There is nothing within the realm of social justice literature that is close to the breath about modern social movements than these books.&nbsp;<b>These are engaging, critical, exciting and outstanding intersectional books that respectfully speak about the pitfalls and successes for social change.</b>&nbsp;They're perfect for an introduction to peace studies or intersectional social justice class and touch on everything from Black and queer liberation, to prison abolition and animal rights." --&nbsp;Dr. Anthony J. Nocella II, Assistant Professor of Criminology and Co-editor of&nbsp;<i>Igniting a Revolution: Voices in Defense of the Earth</i><br>"<i>Full Spectrum Resistance&nbsp;</i>is the most thorough, intelligent, and contemporary handbook on how to change everything that exists, to my knowledge. If you're just now figuring out that all that letter-writing and voting was completely pointless and you want one source that will answer all those nagging questions coherently and in lots of useful detail, read these books. If you, like me, thought you already knew everything and wouldn't have read this book except that you were asked to review it, I found a lot of analysis in here that challenged my perspective in useful ways. But what makes this book such an unexpected treasure is the wide variety of examples, from ancient history to modern times, that Aric McBay explores, that provide such insight for us into what has worked and what hasn't.&nbsp;<b>A firm believer in the idea that you can't forge the future unless you understand how we got to the present, Aric gives us the backstory on so many exciting and inspiring social movements and struggles around the world that I had never heard of, and provides really important insight into some of the more familiar ones.</b>" -- David Rovics, singer/songwriter and host of&nbsp;<i>This Week with David Rovics</i><br><i><br><br></i>"Every political generation thinks massive social change is around the corner, but activist movements more often collapse instead of becoming living revolutions of those changes.

We are accustomed to protests that offer a fun playbook of marches, banners, chants, and so on. But McBay is seriously committed to revolutionary transformation and he is not satisfied to examine only those protests that conform comfortably to the usual catechism of non-violence. Nor does he adopt the sociological preoccupations with the social factors that shape the collective effort. Instead, his unwavering focus is on strategies that win." -- Frances Fox Piven, Author of&nbsp;<i>Challenging Authority</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Poor People's Movements</i><br>"Drawing from both years of personal experience in social movements as well as important lessons from history,&nbsp;<i>Full Spectrum Resistance</i>&nbsp;is chock-full of examples of resistance movements using a diversity of tactics to fight and win.

I feel indebted to McBay for his work combing through the lessons of many dozens of resistance movements, ensuring that each analysis is accompanied by an illustration of these lessons in action.&nbsp;<b><i>FSR</i>'s lessons not only inform how we might form organizations to enact social change, but also reveal how other types of organization can work in concert with each other to effectively push for substantial social change."</b>&nbsp;-- Sakura Saunders, Activist and Organizer<br><br>"For more than two decades, Aric McBay has been a thoughtful, principled and challenging voice for social movements in Canada and around the world. In these two volumes, he has distilled hundreds of hours of inspiring conversations with many different revolutionaries and organizers. They have rich experiences to share, both successes and failures along the way.&nbsp;The advice in these pages is practical, reflective, and deeply detailed. At the same time, it is visionary, hinting at the ways we can shape the future together.&nbsp;<b><i>Full Spectrum Resistance</i>&nbsp;is a resource that is an absolute must on the bookshelves of anyone who wants to make a better world--both seasoned activists and those who are new to the struggle. There is so much we can learn from each other.</b>" --Sara Falconer, director of digital communications at Canadian Red Cross<br>"<i>In&nbsp;Full&nbsp;Spectrum Resistance</i>, Aric McBay tackles the most important topic on the planet today - how to develop successful grassroots resistance groups--and in doing so, courageously uses the full spectrum of analysis without fear of breaching the limits of acceptable debate established by the status quo. He meticulously analyses successful and failed grassroots campaigns throughout history to help activists in determining the logistics, tactics and strategies that will win.&nbsp;<b>Too many books offer no solution.

They shared the same blue eyes, strong cheekbones, and full mouth, but whenever Bennie looked at Alice Connelly, all she could see were their differences. Tonight, Bennie had on a khaki suit, white shirt, and brown pumps, her lawyer uniform. Alice had on tight shorts with a low-cut black top, flaunting cleavage that Bennie didn&#x2019;t even know they had. She made a mental note to look down her shirt, after she got home.<br>Alice was making dinner and she opened the oven door, releasing the aroma of roasting chicken. &#x201c;Finally, it&#x2019;s ready.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Smells great.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You sound surprised.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not at all.&#x201d; Bennie changed the subject. &#x201c;I like your new house, it&#x2019;s great.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, right.&#x201d; Alice turned, carving fork in hand. &#x201c;Why are you being so condescending?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You are, too. It&#x2019;ll look better when I move all my stuff in, and the rent is low, since the estate can&#x2019;t sell it. That&#x2019;s the only way I could afford it. I don&#x2019;t have your money.&#x201d;<br>Bennie let it go. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s good that it came furnished.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This crap? It&#x2019;s dead people furniture.&#x201d; Alice pushed back a smooth strand of hair, yet another difference between them. She blew-dry her hair straight, and her eyeliner was perfect. Bennie let her hair curl naturally and thought ChapStick was makeup.<br>She sipped her wine, feeling warm. There was no air-conditioning, and the kitchen was small and spare except for knobby wooden chairs and a dark wood table. A greenish glass fixture gave little light, and cracks zigzagged down the plaster like summer lightning. Still the cottage had a rustic charm, especially set in the rolling countryside of southeastern Pennsylvania, an hour or so outside of Philadelphia.<br>Alice plopped the chicken on the table, then sat down. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t panic, it&#x2019;s organic.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re eating healthy now, huh?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What do you mean? I always did. So, are you dating anybody?&#x201d; Alice asked.<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How long&#x2019;s it been since you got laid?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nice talk.&#x201d; Bennie bit into a potato, which tasted good. &#x201c;If I remembered sex, I&#x2019;d miss it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever happened to that lawyer you lived with? What was his name again?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Grady Wells.&#x201d; Bennie felt a pang. She&#x2019;d get over Grady, any decade now.<br>&#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t work out.&#x201d; Bennie ate quickly. It had taken forever to get here from Philly, in rush-hour traffic. She wouldn&#x2019;t get home until midnight, which wasn&#x2019;t the way she wanted to end an exhausting week.<br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;d you see after Grady?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nobody serious.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So he&#x2019;s the one that got away?&#x201d;<br>Bennie kept her head down, hiding her expression. She couldn&#x2019;t understand how Alice always intuited so much about her. They&#x2019;d never lived together, even as babies, though Alice claimed to have memories from the womb. Bennie couldn&#x2019;t even remember where she put her car keys.<br>&#x201c;So, what&#x2019;s new in your life? Don&#x2019;t give me the official version. I read the website.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nothing but work. How about you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m seeing a few nice guys, and I&#x2019;m working out. I even joined a gym.&#x201d; Alice made a muscle of her slim arm. &#x201c;See?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Good.&#x201d; Bennie had been an elite rower in her time, but she&#x2019;d been too busy lately to exercise. &#x201c;By the way, I hear great things about the job you&#x2019;re doing at PLG. Karen thinks you&#x2019;re terrific.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Are you keeping tabs on me, now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Of course not. I ran into her, at a benefit.&#x201d;<br>Alice arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;Does she have to report to you just because you got me the job?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No, but if I see her, we talk. She knows me, like she knows most of the bar association. She has to, we all support the Public Law Group.&#x201d; Bennie felt a headache coming on. She&#x2019;d lost a motion in court this morning, and it was turning out to be the high point of her day.<br>&#x201c;So what did she say, exactly? She loves to gossip.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t like that.&#x201d; Bennie sipped her wine, but it didn&#x2019;t help. &#x201c;All she said was that they like you. They have you doing office administration, payroll, and personnel, in addition to the paralegal work.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not anymore. I quit.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Bennie said, blind-sided. &#x201c;You quit PLG? When?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The other day. It wasn&#x2019;t for me, and the money sucked.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;But you have to start somewhere.&#x201d; Bennie couldn&#x2019;t hide her dismay. She&#x2019;d stuck her neck out for Alice and now her friends at PLG would be left in the lurch. &#x201c;They would have promoted you, in time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;When, ten years?&#x201d; Alice rolled her eyes. &#x201c;The work was boring, and the people were so freaking annoying. I&#x2019;d rather work with you, at Rosato &amp; Associates.&#x201d;<br>Bennie&#x2019;s mouth went dry. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine Alice at her firm. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need a paralegal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can answer phones.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I already have a receptionist.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;So fire her ass.&#x201d;<br>Bennie felt cranky. Maybe it was the headache, which was a doozy. &#x201c;I like her. I would never do that to her.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not even for me? We&#x2019;re the only family we have.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; Bennie tried to keep a civil tongue. Being her sister&#x2019;s keeper was getting old. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t fire her. I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Okay, fine, then think outside the box. You need somebody to run the office, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I run the office.&#x201d;<br>Alice snorted. &#x201c;If you ask me, you could use a hand with personnel. Those girls who work for you need a life lesson, especially the little one, Mary DiNunzio. Time for girlfriend to grow up.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true.&#x201d; Bennie wished she hadn&#x2019;t come. Her stomach felt queasy. Her appetite had vanished. She set down her fork. &#x201c;DiNunzio&#x2019;s a good lawyer. She should make partner next month.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Whatever, then I&#x2019;ll be your assistant. I&#x2019;ll take ninety grand, to start.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Listen, I can&#x2019;t always be the solution to your problems.&#x201d; Bennie&#x2019;s head thundered. &#x201c;I got you a job, and you quit it. If you want another job, go out and find one.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks, Mom.&#x201d; Alice smiled sourly. &#x201c;The economy&#x2019;s in the toilet, if you haven&#x2019;t noticed.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You should have thought of that before, and you&#x2019;ll find something, if you try. You went to college, and you have lots of . . . abilities and, oh, my head. . . .&#x201d; Suddenly the kitchen whirled like spin art, and Bennie collapsed onto the table. Her face landed on the edge of her dirty plate, and her hand upset her water glass.<br>&#x201c;Aww, got a headache?&#x201d; Alice chuckled. &#x201c;Too bad.&#x201d;<br>Bennie didn&#x2019;t know what was happening. She felt impossibly drunk. Her eyes wouldn&#x2019;t stay open.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re such a fool. You think I&#x2019;d really want to work for you?&#x201d;<br>Bennie tried to lift her head up, but couldn&#x2019;t. All her strength had left her body. Sound and colors swirled together.<br>&#x201c;Give it up. It&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br>Bennie watched, helpless, as darkness descended.<br>Excerpted from Think Twice by .<br>Copyright � 2010 by Lisa Scottoline.<br>Published in March 2010 by Roaring Brook Press.<br>All rights reserved.

Born to a prominent southern family, she was married James Chesnut, a U.S. Senator and later aide to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and it was this association that afforded Chesnut a unique perspective on events leading up to and throughout the American Civil War. In addition to her diary, Chesnut wrote two novels, The Captain and the Colonel, and Two Years of My Life, both of which were published posthumously. Chesnut died in 1886.It is hardly too much to say that what Samuel Pepys's diary is to the reign of Charles II, Mary Boykin Chesnut's is to the Confederacy. To thousands now and in years to come it will be a fascinating source of information, an invaluable aid to the understanding of a great period, and a lasting delight.

(<i>Library Journal</i>)</p><h2>The Women</h2><p>For thousands of years, the muscular male body has been an object of admiration and a primary subject of art. Women, on the other hand, have rarely been celebrated for their physical strength or muscular development. But in the late 1970s, women discovered the sport of competitive bodybuilding and began doing the same kind of muscle-specific weight training as their male counterparts.<p> As a result, we are seeing the emergence of a cultural phenomenon without precedent--women attempting to develop the ultimate degree of muscle size, shape, definition and proportion primarily for aesthetic, rather than athletic, purposes. The fact that many women are now both willing and able to devote themselves to creating muscular bodies is one indication of our changing perception of the potential of the female body as we begin the 21st century.</p><p> In <i>The Women,</i> author and photographer Bill Dobbins presents eighty full-color and duotone photographs of top female competitive bodybuilders in a stunning visual exploration of this new phenomenon, and convincingly shows that muscles on women can indeed be beautiful. The photographs, combined with an enlightening text, explore the implications of this new aesthetic for art, sport, and our overall view of the capabilities of women. An unusual and fascinating book for anyone interested in fitness, feminism, photography, or the complex issue of gender, <i>The Women</i> is certain to challenge many perceptions.</p><p></p><p></p></p><p>Bill Dobbins is a photographer, writer, and video maker who has been working with champion bodybuilders for more than a decade. He is the author of five books, including <i>Arnold's Modern Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding,</i> with Arnold Schwarzenegger. His photographs of bodybuilders have been the subject of several one-man exhibitions and have been featured in Joe Weider's publications <i>Muscle &amp; Fitness</i> and <i>Flex.</i> His work has also appeared in <i>Sports Illustrated, Cosmopolitan, Penthouse, Essence,</i> and <i>Newlook.</i>Having experienced a surge in popularity in the 1980s, women's bodybuilding produced a number of how-to books by stars such as Lisa Lyon, Gladys Portugues, and Rachel McLish. Dobbins's book is a gallery of 50 color and black-and-white "art" photos (read: there is some tasteful nudity) showing off the physiques of female bodybuilders in studio settings. The brief text recaps the muscles-vs.-beauty controversy in the sport and emphasizes the special obstacles women face, physically and psychologically, in the form of criticism from family and friends. This book champions the "muscles are beautiful" side. Dobbins, who coauthored The Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding (LJ 9/1/85) with Arnold Schwarzenegger, has extensive photographic experience with bodybuilders, and it shows in these crisp, artful photographs.

In <i>The Lost Continent</i> he re-created the road trips of his childhood; in <i>Neither Here nor There</i> he retraced the route he followed as a young backpacker traversing Europe. When this American transplant to Britain decided to return home, he made a farewell walking tour of the British countryside and produced <i>Notes from a Small Island</i>. Once back on American soil and safely settled in New Hampshire, Bryson once again hears the siren call of the open road--only this time it's a trail. The Appalachian Trail, to be exact. In <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> Bill Bryson tackles what is, for him, an entirely new subject: the American wilderness. Accompanied only by his old college buddy Stephen Katz, Bryson starts out one March morning in north Georgia, intending to walk the entire 2,100 miles to trail's end atop Maine's Mount Katahdin. <p> If nothing else, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is proof positive that the journey <i>is</i> the destination. As Bryson and Katz haul their out-of-shape, middle-aged butts over hill and dale, the reader is treated to both a very funny personal memoir and a delightful chronicle of the trail, the people who created it, and the places it passes through. Whether you plan to make a trip like this one yourself one day or only care to read about it, <i>A Walk in the Woods</i> is a great way to spend an afternoon. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><br></p><h2>Witnesses of War: Children&#39;s Lives Under the Nazis</h2><p>Already hailed as &#x201c;magnificent . . . some of the best historical writing about the aftermath of the war I have ever read . . . stunning&#x201d; <i>(The Guardian)</i>, <i>Witnesses of War</i> breaks new ground in its exploration of the lives and the fate of children of all nationalities under the Nazi regime. <br><br>Children were at the center of Nazi ideology; now we have their history of those years. Their stories open a world we have never seen before. War came home to children as a set of events without precedent, spectacular and terrifying by turns. As the Nazis overran Europe, children were saved or damned according to their race. Precious few remained unscathed during the war, and most suffered a moment that overturned their lives. For some, it was the evacuation to become junior colonists in the East; for others, it was the onset of heavy bombing, the separation of families or learning to keep their parents alive by smuggling food, creating black markets and devising their own escape networks. Some herded women waiting to be shot. Girls manned flak batteries; boys confronted Soviet tanks. <br><br>Drawing on an untouched wealth of original material &#x2013; school assignments; juvenile diaries; letters from evacuation camps, reformatories and asylums; letters to fathers at the front lines; even accounts of children&#x2019;s games &#x2014; Nicholas Stargardt breaks stereotypes of victimhood and trauma to give us the gripping individual stories of the generation Hitler made.</p><p>Nicholas Stargardt is the son of a German-Jewish father and Australian mother. Born in Melbourne, he has lived in Australia, Japan, England and Germany. He studied at King&#x2019;s College, Cambridge, and is a fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, where he teaches modern European history. <i>Witnesses of War</i> is his second book; his first, <i>The German Idea of Militarism</i>, was published in 1994. He has written widely on the history of modern Germany, political and social thought and the Holocaust. He has two sons and is married to the historian Lyndal Roper.Chapter 1 <br>The Home Front <br><br>Germans at war <br><br>Janina came out of the privy at the bottom of her grandparents&#x2019; garden on the morning of 1 September 1939 to see two planes circling overhead. The sound of their machine guns opening up brought her parents, grandparents and brothers running out of the house to join her. Then they all rushed back inside again to listen to the radio. They just caught the announcement of the German attack on Poland, which had begun at daybreak, then the voice faded away as the batteries died. &#x201c;Grandpa turned the switch off and looked at our anguished faces,&#x201d; ten-year-old Janina noted in her diary at the end of that long day. &#x201c;He knelt in front of the picture of Jesus Christ and started to pray aloud.&#x201d; They joined him in the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer. Janina had been expecting to return with her parents from the little village of Borowa-G�ra, where they had spent the summer holidays with her grandparents, to Warsaw for the start of school on 4 September, and had been happily anticipating the set of new school books they had promised to buy her. The ten-year-old knew that something momentous had just occurred, but had no images yet of war. Even those adults who had lived through the First World War in Poland could have no conception of what the second would be like.<br><br>That September the start of the new autumn term was seriously disrupted across Europe. In Germany, schools remained closed at the end of the summer holidays and children hung around the gates to catch a glimpse of reservists as they poured in to register at these temporary mobilisation centres. In the rural calm of the Eifel, west of the Rhine, two little girls enjoyed the envy of all their friends for being allowed to stand in the village square with a bag of apples and throw them to the passing troops. Unfortunately, for many older children, like sixteen-year-old Gretel Bechtold, the excitement soon died down: the French fired no shots at the West Wall and soon she had to go back to school. <br><br>As street lights were turned off and windows blacked out, Germany&#x2019;s towns and cities were plunged into a night-time darkness they had not experienced at night since the pre-industrial era. In Essen, little girls started pretending to be the nightwatchman who patrolled the streets reminding people to conceal their lights by calling out &#x201c;Blackout! Blackout!&#x201d; All too soon classes began again. Dangling gas masks and satchels over their shoulders on the way to school, many children found they had to write assignments when they got there about blacking out and other measures of civil defence against air attack. What with trams and trucks colliding in the unlit streets and pedestrians missing their footing as they stepped off the kerb, the most significant change to strike one Hamburg boy, after four months at war, was the increase in traffic accidents. <br><br>In September 1939, there were no scenes in Germany reminiscent of the jubilation of August 1914, however short-lived and partial that mood of public ecstasy may in fact have been. Even strongly Nazi families were unsure how to view the outbreak of war. As fourteen-year-old Liese listened to the radio broadcast of the F�hrer&#x2019;s Reichstag speech in Thuringia in central Germany, she squealed with pleasure. But after only two weeks of war, she was asking her father what he thought the chances were of bringing things to a speedy conclusion: <br><br>If we get into a real war with England, don&#x2019;t you think it will last at least two years? For once he starts a war the Englishman throws everything into it and mobilises his whole empire, for the Englishman has never lost a war yet. <br><br>Her father, a reserve officer who strongly supported the regime, agreed. As might be expected from someone with experience of the terrible blood-letting of the First World War, he told her that France remained the key. Meanwhile, Liese&#x2019;s mother purchased a good-quality radio, a Telefunken-Super, and they set up a map of Poland next to it so that&#x2014;just like in schools across the Reich&#x2014;they could mark the advance of the German troops on it with little swastika flags after each news broadcast. <br><br>When the German attack began at dawn on 1 September, the Wehrmacht found the Polish Army still in the midst of mobilisation. With the advantage of surprise, the Luftwaffe destroyed many of the 400 largely obsolete planes of the Polish Air Force on the ground, gaining immediate air supremacy. Thereafter, its 2,000 aircraft practised their new tactics of war, giving battlefield support to the German Army, while its sixty well-armed divisions swept over the borders from East Prussia in the north, Slovakia and the recently occupied Czech lands in the south, and along a broad front in the west stretching from Silesia to Pomerania. Defending such borders was impossible, and the Polish High Command abandoned its attempt to do so on 6 September. Even the attempt by the Poles to defend the major industrial and urban centres involved spreading their forty ill-equipped divisions and 150 tanks too thinly; the Wehrmacht could pick out its battleground and concentrate its 2,600 tanks there. <br><br>As Germans flocked to the cinemas, far more eager to see the newsreels of the war&#x2014;the Wochenschau&#x2014;than the feature films which <br><br>followed, their senses were bombarded with a new and sensually stimulating kind of photography. Aerial photography had been tried out since the First World War, but now the spectators could feel themselves being swept downwards in a furious nosedive, at a speed of over 330 miles per hour. For once, police reports showed satisfied audiences, as they viewed the Polish campaign through the eyes of the German dive-bomber pilots. Small children in Essen queued up to jump off the chicken coop, screeching &#x201c;Stuka!&#x201d; as they mimicked their screaming wail. By late September 1939, the well-informed American journalist William Shirer could find no one in Berlin, &#x201c;even among those who don&#x2019;t like the regime, who sees anything wrong in the German destruction of Poland.&#x201d; <br><br>Marion Lubien from Essen was one of many German teenagers who kept war diaries. On 3 September, she noted the capture of Tschenstochau (Cze�stochowa), on 6 September, &#x201c;the industrial area of Upper Silesia virtually unharmed in German hands,&#x201d; and on the 9 September her bulletin read, &#x201c;Lodz occupied. The F�hrer in Lodz.&#x201d; But this fourteen-year-old girl kept to the clipped and stilted language of the Wehrmacht bulletins to the home front. Like most of the rest of the country, she may have been glued to the radio, fascinated by the first newsreel images, and temporarily intoxicated with a sense of victorious power&#x2014;but the war itself remained distant and unemotional. Not until the first bombs fell near her house in October 1940 would her chronicle of the war leap into the first person. <br><br>On 5 October Warsaw surrendered, bringing hostilities to a close. But by mid-October, Poland had already become a non-subject in Germany and an undercover reporter for the German Social Democrats could find &#x201c;hardly a single person who still spoke of the &#x2018;victory&#x2019;.&#x201d; Some hoped that now that the dispute over Poland had been settled with the country&#x2019;s dismemberment, peaceful relations with the Western powers could be restored. And Hitler played to such sentiments when he addressed the German Reichstag on 6 October. Insisting once again that he had no territorial claims against Britain and France, the F�hrer suggested that, with Poland&#x2019;s demise, the casus belli had also disappeared. This was a line the German public was more likely to appreciate than the French or British. When Daladier and Chamberlain rejected Hitler&#x2019;s olive branch, many German citizens joined Liese and her father in concluding that it was primarily British intransigence that was preventing a settlement. By mid-October, children were singing ditties about Chamberlain in the street and mimicking his famous habit of carrying an umbrella. <br><br>However much the regime might insist that the British and French declaration of war on 3 September, rather than Germany&#x2019;s attack on Poland, had started a conflict which the German government was only too anxious to end, nothing could conceal the fact that the war was not yet popular at home. Even some of his military commanders had openly warned Hitler that Germany could not expect to defeat France and Britain. Hitler&#x2019;s foreign policy triumphs had done much to realign public opinion during the three years before the war, but they had not removed the fear of war itself. When German troops had marched across the Rhine in 1936, working-class districts, renowned for their earlier anti-Nazi sentiments, had hung out swastika flags for the first time. Few objected to rolling back the conditions the Allies had imposed on Germany and Austria after their defeat in 1918. Hitler&#x2019;s success in reversing Bismarck&#x2019;s &#x201c;Little German&#x201d; unification of 1871 by drawing Austria back into a &#x201c;Greater German Reich&#x201d; was an achievement German and Austrian Social Democrats could also endorse. After all, they had themselves attempted it at the end of the First World War, only to be thwarted by the Allies. Whether they believed in the pan-German creed of bringing all Germans &#x201c;home&#x201d; into the Reich, or in restoring Prussia&#x2019;s and Austria&#x2019;s eighteenth- and nineteenth-century territories at the expense of the East European successor states, or simply subscribed to Nazi demands for colonial &#x201c;living space,&#x201d; by 1938 and 1939 few Germans objected in principle to Hitler&#x2019;s demands against Czechoslovakia or Poland. Success had nurtured both ambition and a growing complacency among the population at large. <br><br>But the Czech crisis had lasted long enough&#x2014;from May to October 1938&#x2014;to reveal just how much the German people feared a new conflict on the scale of the First World War.

It comes to a man&#x2019;s career when all of his cautions&#x2014;all that he has held close and private for fear of damaging his reputation and his ambitions for advancement&#x2014;all in a single moment lose their constraint. The moment I speak of, one might surmise, arrives the day&#x2014;or more accurately, the first chime after midnight&#x2014;when one realizes that further advancement is impossible. Indeed, that caution never did a thing to augment success, because success never came to pass. Resolved I may be that mine was a life gustily pursued, riches admirably attained and so forth, but the resolution is a murky one nonetheless.

And the night would draw on, in laughter and tears and expostulations and fervent prayers for forgiveness (eyes ashine from my languid explorations of the paramour, the silk-drenched beds and the flash of full thigh and bosom) as if the spirits of the sand and the gods of the whirlwinds might flutter in shame and breathless shock&#x2014;oh no, my friends, see them twist in envy!</i><br><i>My tales, let it be known, sweep the breadth of the world.

The subject was baseball, the columnist George Will, and the book Men at Work. His antiromantic love letter was warmly received by those who love baseball. Critics called it &#34;an excellent book about excellence&#34; (Barbara Grizzuti Harrison), &#34;a classic [that] may even stand up as the best baseball book of the 1990s&#34; (Jerome Holtzman), &#34;a hit -- a triple off the center field wall&#34; (Roger Angell), and by readers who kept it at the top of bestseller lists for more than five months. He&#39;s back. George Will returns to baseball with more than seventy finely honed pieces about the sometimes recondite, sometimes frustrating, always passionately felt National Pastime. Here are Will&#39;s eulogy for the late Curt Flood (&#34;Dred Scott in Spikes&#34;), Will on Ted Williams (&#34;When Ted Williams retired in 1960, a sportswriter said that Boston knew how Britain felt when it lost India. Indeed. Britain felt diminished, but also a bit relieved&#34;), and on his own baseball career (&#34;I was a very late draft choice of the Mittendorf Funeral Home Panthers. Our color was black&#34;). Here are subjects ranging from the author&#39;s 1977 purchase of a single share of stock in the Chicago Cubs, a purchase brokered by Warren Buffett (&#34;a St. Louis Cardinal fan, but not otherwise sinister&#34;), to the collision between Pete Rose and Bart Giamatti, to the building of Camden Yards in Baltimore, to the dismantling of the 1997 World Series Champion Florida Martins. With new material, including an essay on the art of baseball broadcasting, featuring ESPN play-by-play man Jon Miller, and incorporating more than seventy photos, Bunts is certain to be for 1998 what Men at Work was for 1990 -- &#34;inquisitive and extraordinarily nimble-minded ... this season&#39;s baseball book of choice&#34; (The Wall Street Journal).</p><p>"Bunts," explains peripatetic political commentator and baseball rhapsodist George Will, "are modest and often useful things." So is his latest, fittingly titled foray into the National Pastime. Unlike his splendid <i>Men at Work</i>, which offered long, detailed exegeses on the way Tony Gwynn, Orel Hershiser, Cal Ripken, Jr., and Tony La Russa sweat the details of mastering specific aspects of the game, <i>Bunts</i> is a less unified, but wider ranging collection of Will's shorter baseball journalism--columns, essays, and book reviews--assembled chronologically from 1974 through the 1997 season. Each piece may be brief, but taken individually or as a whole, the collection is certainly useful, and like a good outfielder, it covers plenty of territory.<p> Will, to be sure, is an elegant writer, a little verbose at times, but dependably knowledgeable, stirringly erudite, thoughtfully opinionated, and, here and there, delightfully personal--as in the volume's leadoff hitter in which he traces his own conservative principles to growing up a Cub fan. His lineup continues with a breezy ode to Louisville Sluggers; encomiums to Casey Stengel, Camden Yards, Ripken, Gwynn, and Curt Flood; a startling about-face on the DH; an early homage to <i>statsmeister</i> Bill James; and indictments on the selfishness of Ted Williams, the callousness of the owners in labor- and fan-relations, and the sordid personalities of Pete Rose and Billy Martin. The volume ends with a pair of doubles in the form of larger essays on Jon Miller and the distinctive craft of broadcasting, and a concluding one on the state of the game.</p><p> "Baseball," Will observes, "is a habit. The slowly rising crescendo of each game, the rhythm of the long season--these are the essentials and they are remarkably unchanged over nearly a century and a half. Of how many American institutions can that be said?" The answer, of course, is not many, which is why <i>Bunts</i> provides a necessary and pleasing public service. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>In this New York Times bestseller, Pulitzer Prize-winning author George F. Will returns to baseball with more than seventy finely honed pieces about the sometimes recondite, sometimes frustrating, yet always passionately felt national pastime. Here are Will's eulogy for the late Curt Flood ("Dred Scott in Spikes"), Will on Ted Williams ("When Ted Williams retired in 1960, a sportswriter said that Boston knew how Britain felt when it lost India. Indeed. Britain felt diminished, but also a bit relieved"), and Will on his own baseball career ("I was a very late draft choice of the Mittendorf Funeral Home Panthers. Our color was black"). Here are subjects ranging from the author's 1977 purchase of a single share of stock in the Chicago Cubs to the memorable 1998 season, which is discussed in an all-new essay.<p>For fans of Men at Work and Will's other baseball writings, this book is as pleasurable as a well-executed bunt.</p></p><h2>Ways of Imperfection: An Exploration of Christian Spirituality</h2><p>Spirituality has to do with a whole Christian vision of life, not simply with methods of prayer or contemplation. Simon Tugwell approaches the subject through the idea of &#34;imperfection,&#34; tracing this theme through a series of spiritual writers from different periods of Christian history. He ranges from the Apostolic and Desert Fathers through St. Francis of Assisi and Mother Julian of Norwich to St. Th�rese of Lisieux. These are penetrating and illuminating studies which show how from the start and throughout its history the Christian vision is not one for an elite but for everyone, sinners all. The religion of the cross is the religion of failure turned to account, creatively.</p><p></p><h2>The Cultural Contradictions Of Capitalism</h2><p>The noted sociologist argues that the attitudes, values, and expectations engendered by capitalism have resulted in contradictory cultural tendencies whose increasing ideological incompatibilities threaten Western society&#39;s continuation</p><p>Since its original publication in 1976, The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism has been hailed as an intellectual tour de force that redefines how we think about the relationship among econmomics, culture, and social change. Daniel Bell, the author of such other modern classics as The End of Ideology and The Coming of Post-Industrial Society, argues that the unbounded drive of modern capitalism undermines the moral foundations of the original Protestant ethic that ushered in capitalism itself. In a major new afterword, Bell offers a bracing perspective on contemporary Western society, from the end of the Cold War to the rise and fall of postmodernism, revealing the crucial cultural fault lines we face as the twenty-first century approaches.<b>Daniel Bell</b> is the Henry Ford II Professor of Social Sciences Emeritus at Harvard University and Scholar-in-Residence at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

The author of many literary novels and stories in practically every genre, his novels have won and been shortlisted for numerous awards including the Hugo, Nebula, World Fantasy, Whitbread and Guardian Fiction Prize. In 1999, he was given the World Fantasy Life Achievement Award; in 2001, he was inducted into the SF Hall of Fame; and in 2007, he was named a SFWA Grandmaster. Michael Moorcock is also a musician who has performed since the seventies with his own band, the Deep Fix; and, as a member of the prog rock band, Hawkwind, won a gold disc. His tenure as editor of New Worlds magazine in the sixties and seventies is seen as the high watermark of SF editorship in the UK, and was crucial in the development of the SF New Wave. Michael Moorcock&#39;s literary creations include Hawkmoon, Corum, Von Bek, Jerry Cornelius and, of course, his most famous character, Elric. He has been compared to, among others, Balzac, Dumas, Dickens, James Joyce, Ian Fleming, J.R.R. Tolkien and Robert E. Howard.

As traditional codes of behavior have given way to an increasingly informal society, many people are disconcerted by the current lack of guidelines. The established rules are as important as ever, but need adaptation for the complications and developments of the twenty-first century. The Debrett&#39;s New Guide to Etiquette and Modern Manners cuts through the confusion to combine the very best of traditional standards of conduct with acceptable modern innovations. Packed with no-nonsense step-by-step advice, it covers everything from basic table manners to how to equip yourself at the grandest royal and diplomatic gatherings. Written with clarity and wit, this book celebrates the charm, beauty, and fascination of classic good manners, and their enduring role in a civilized society.</p><p>John Morgan was senior editorial contributor at Conde Nast, and was the Associate Editor of <i>GQ </i>(Europe).

They are also, in an age when procreation is increasingly regarded as positively miraculous, trumpeted to a quite unprecedented extent.<br>BIRTH<br>Announcement of a Birth<br>This is traditionally the duty of the father, who must ring any immediate relations who were not present at the birth. Close family should be the first to hear the glad tidings, followed by prospective godparents, friends and colleagues. It is then customary to place a birth announcement in the personal column of newspapers. It is also increasingly usual to leave an announcement on the telephone answering machines of close friends, adding whether or not you are receiving calls.<br>The choice of wording for a newspaper announcement varies according to personal style, although the proper form is short and elegant.<br>PROUDPARENTS &#x2013; On 22 December, to John and Jane, a son.<br>The inclusion of the year is optional. Some couples like to add the name of the hospital, the infant&#x2019;s name and the mother&#x2019;s maiden name: this, although well intentioned, is not comme il faut. Other details such as &#x2018;little brother for Andy, Pandy and Mandy&#x2019; or &#x2018;long-awaited grandchild for Don and Doris&#x2019; are even more inappropriate and should never appear. As for the entry that once appeared in a west country local paper and which included &#x2018;thanking all concerned&#x2019;, nothing needs to be said.<br>The form for single mothers takes the same pattern:<br>PROUDPARENT &#x2013; On 30 December, to Susan, a son.<br>Smart babies are often announced, at the discretion of the social editors and often free of charge, in the Court &amp; Social pages. It has also recently become the custom, immediately on deciding a baby&#x2019;s name, to send out American-style birth announcements (see Chapter 8). These can look very smart. The same cannot be said of a card showing a jolly picture of the new family, with written details on the back. After all, as one mother said: &#x2018;I was half gaga at the time, looked absolutely at my worst and am now embarrassed about these images being in constant circulation.&#x2019;<br>Registration of Birth<br>Babies have to be legally registered. In England and Wales this has to be done within forty-two days. In Scotland the period of grace is only twenty-one days. Apart from this slight difference the procedure is largely the same throughout Great Britain. Babies are registered with their local registrar of births. If the infant is born when away from home, it is possible to declare the child locally but register it through the post to the baby&#x2019;s local area. The registering of babies by married couples is very straightforward. Either parent can do the registration, as only one signature is needed. Details of both parents are put on the certificate. Although most children automatically assume the father&#x2019;s surname, an infant can be given the mother&#x2019;s or any other of choice. The position with unmarried people is slightly more complicated. The mother always has to be present. In order for the father&#x2019;s details to be included in the birth entry, he should attend the register office with the mother and sign the register with her, or he can fill in a paternity declaration on a special form from the registrar&#x2019;s office. This needs to be witnessed by a solicitor or Commissioner for Oaths and is brought along by the woman when she attends the registration. Either the mother&#x2019;s or father&#x2019;s name can be used. In some circumstances when a father denies paternity, the mother can take him to court, where it is possible to order DNA tests to prove fatherhood and thus force him to recognise the child as his. On the other hand, if the mother does not want the father&#x2019;s name on the birth certificate a line is drawn through the space for paternal details. Alternatively a mother can also add the man&#x2019;s details later, should circumstances change, such as marriage, and therefore re-register the baby.<br>Hospital Visits<br>If you are not an immediate family member it is thoughtful, no matter how happy you are for the new mother, to delay your visit for a day or so, to give time for the immediate family to spend time with their newborn and for the mother to regain her strength. This is to ensure that she, who will undoubtedly be feeling drained by the experience of childbirth, is not overtaxed with visitors. Particularly if she has had a difficult birth, being besieged with callers can make her feel totally exhausted and confused. A mother of great experience recommends that visits from well-wishers should be no longer than twenty minutes.<br>Presents<br>As far as the newborn is concerned, it is necessary only for immediate family to bring presents, although friends may give something if they wish. This can range from a practical item for the nursery to something much more substantial and permanent, such as the two million pound trust fund that was recently settled on a very lucky three-day-old baby. Clothes, unless with prior consultation, are not recommended, as most mothers have very strong ideas about how their children are to look.<br>In all the excitement surrounding the baby, it is important to remember the star performer &#x2013; the mother. An acquaintance says: &#x2018;After a birth, women long to feel feminine again and thus welcome gifts such as delicious soaps, a beautiful nightdress and, of course, flowers.&#x2019; If sending a present &#x2013; particularly flowers &#x2013; rather than taking it in person, it is sensible to check how long the mother will be staying in hospital. Nowadays, this can be a very short time indeed. Some experts also recommend that the new baby&#x2019;s siblings are also given a small present, as their noses are often out of joint after the birth of the new arrival.<br>Letters of Congratulation<br>Friends who cannot visit should write a short letter of congratulation to the happy parents. This is always addressed to the mother and could read:<br>Dear Susan,<br>I was so thrilled to hear of the arrival of your long-awaited daughter. She will make a delightful addition to the family and help keep those boisterous boys in order.<br>With much love,<br>Freddie Well-Wisher<br>If time is short, it is just acceptable to send a postcard bearing a suitable image.<br>Single Mothers<br>Many women choose to have babies without becoming attached to a man in the conventional sense. Others have accidents. In both cases it behoves family and friends to be extra supportive, as the mother will have to cope with her new family without the traditional help of a spouse.<br>Complications<br>If there are complications it is rude to ask too many questions. If a child is born with defects, unless these abnormalities are absolutely horrendous, family and friends must behave in a positive way. If a baby is stillborn or dies shortly after birth, this awful event must be treated as a family death, with letters of condolence sent to the parents.<br>Breast-Feeding in Public<br>It is bad manners to expel any liquid from any orifice in public, and breast-feeding is no different. Nevertheless, this habit remains a very sensitive area. During the sixties and seventies, many western women asserted their right to breast-feed in public. The fact that this practice has not become widespread is largely due to the fact that many onlookers (women as well as men of different generations) find the sight embarrassing, even revolting. With this in mind, well-mannered mothers should breast-feed in private. Thoughtful hosts offer lactating visitors a quiet room where they can feed away from the general throng.<br>BAPTISM<br>Despite the secularisation of society, a surprising number of babies are baptised. Research suggests that one in four babies is christened into the Church of England alone. However, there can be problems. Although most clergy are happy to baptise babies, many harbour reservations about christening babies of families who do not attend church, claiming that nonpractising Christians are unlikely to bring their children up in a truly Christian manner. Others take the more relaxed view that by baptising an infant, the Church has acquired a new recruit.<br>Many clergymen are reluctant to give private baptisms, preferring to uphold the Church of England&#x2019;s current official line that baptism is a rebirth and a welcoming to the larger Christian communion, and thus infants should be christened during normal Sunday service in the presence of the parish&#x2019;s congregation. Others do semi-private group baptisms of several babies. Policy varies from parish to parish. However, most parents still, quite understandably, want the &#x2018;specialness&#x2019; of a private christening with friends and family rather than a public affair, and there are plenty of vicars who will oblige with a private rite. As in many aspects of contemporary religion, it is down to the discretion of your local incumbent.<br>Baptism in the Church of England<br>Within the Church of England, christenings can happen at any age, although the most frequent time is at around three or four months. Clergymen hate leaving it too late, not just for the sake of the infant&#x2019;s soul, but because the older babies are, the heavier, more wriggly and increasingly difficult they become to manoeuvre. It is usual for the ceremony to take place at the local parish church. However, if parents wish for the service to take place at another church, they must first get the permission of both ministers.<br>In the case of church-going families, the arrangement of a christening is only a formality. However, should the parents never attend church, most clergy will want some assurance that the infant, once baptised, will be brought up in the tenets of the Christian faith. The majority of parishes now insist on some sort of preparation prior to the ceremony: this can range from a single conversation about the meaning of the service to a series of classes or training sessions.<br>Normally, the local parish priest performs the service. However, some couples wish to have the ceremony conducted by a family member or friend who is in Holy Orders. In these cases it is important to remember that men of the cloth can be as territorial as those of the laity, and thus the local priest&#x2019;s permission will have to be tactfully sought. Also, should a child be christened outside its own diocese, then it is courteous to inform the bishop by letter that this is happening.<br>There are two main liturgies to choose from. The first is the traditional service from the Book of Common Prayer, which is very beautiful, places a strong emphasis on the renunciation of evil and is preferred by many to the revised texts in the Alternative Service Book. The latter is written in more modern English and is designed to present a more contemporary view of Christianity.<br>Whichever service is chosen, the central act of the ceremony remains largely constant. Parents and godparents gather around the font with the baby and are asked by the minister to affirm their belief in Christ and the renunciation of all evil. Holding the child, the priest then pours or sprinkles holy water on to the infant&#x2019;s forehead and using the child&#x2019;s new Christian names declares: &#x2018;I baptise you in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&#x2019; The priest then makes the sign of the cross on the young forehead. Sometimes a lighted candle is presented to the family and specially blessed oils are used to anoint the baby. It is usual for the father to go to the vestry to register the christening. There is always a fee payable for a certificate of baptism, and should the baptism have been a private affair, then a small donation to church funds is welcomed. There is one family who, as their gesture of appreciation, organised for flowers to be delivered to the church for three Sundays after the christening of their newborn. This lovely gesture was much appreciated.<br>The dress for the christening ought to be special. Women should wear hats and men dark suits. The infant is resplendent in a white gown (this is often part of a family&#x2019;s history) that signifies purity. Sometimes a little white bonnet is also worn. Should you wish to baptise your child in an ancestral gown, it is sensible to remember that in the past babies were smaller than today. Thus your bouncing baby might be too big for the antique: certainly an early christening is advised.<br>Announcements in the Press<br>Written announcements of christenings in the Court &amp; Social pages of national newspapers are increasingly rare, although traditionally minded families like to keep up the custom. Typical wording could read:<br>The infant daughter of The Earl and Countess of Proudparentland was christened Augusta Boadicea by the Reverend Timothy Tremble at St Margaret&#x2019;s, Westminster, on Thursday 21 December. The god-parents are The Hon. Tiggy Tintangel, Mrs Peter Pork-Sausage and The Lord Tickle.<br>Note, in the case of a male infant, the names of the godfathers precede those of godmothers.<br>Catholic Baptism<br>This tends to be a rather more elaborate and lengthy affair than the Anglican rite, although in recent years it has been simplified by innovations from the Vatican. Although practices vary from parish to parish, the Roman Catholic Church, like the Church of England, now officially discourages the practice of private baptism, although in most cases the choice of baptism during mass or outside it is available (and there are still priests who will perform a private service). One godparent (or sponsor) has to be a Roman Catholic of good standing, and only his or her name is entered in the register. Sometimes there is a hymn at the beginning of the service. The parents and godparents trace the sign of the cross on the infant&#x2019;s forehead. Then follows a reading from Scripture, and a short homily and prayers. After this the infant is anointed with catechumenal oil by the priest. Parents and god-parents renounce Satan and profess their faith in God. The actual baptism is then performed. After this the child is anointed with chrism oils and wrapped in a pure white robe, and its father or godfather holds a candle lit from the Paschal candle held by the priest. This elaborate ritual concludes with the saying of the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer, a blessing and the signing of the register. If the service has included an organist, there might be a fee payable to him. The priest does not charge for his services, but an offering is always appreciated. It is most important to keep the baptismal certificate, as it will be needed for future rites of religious passage, such as weddings, and for applications to Roman Catholic schools.<br>Jewish Procedures<br>Traditionally, male infants are subjected to an ancient rite called Brit Milah, at which they are circumcised at an official ceremony presided over by a mohel. This usually takes place seven days after the birth and is held at home and not at the synagogue. The rite is attended by the parents, grandparents and friends. Sandeks, the Jewish equivalent of godparents, will also be present. These may be any Jewish male, and to be asked to fulfil this role is a particular honour in the faith. The godfather holds the infant during the procedure and the father recites a special prayer. The mohel is the one who actually wields the knife, as well as reciting prayers and a blessing over a goblet of wine. The baby is then given its Hebrew name which signifies its initiation into the faith. It is considered bad luck to make any reference to the baby&#x2019;s name until after the circumcision. Female infants are spared this religious initiation and are expected only to attend the synagogue on the first Sabbath after the birth, when the father is called up or reads the Torah and the baby is given its Hebrew name. Some Reform and Liberal Jews have stripped the ritual circumcision of so...</p><h2>One Bright Shining Hope</h2><p>&#34;When you save a girl, you save generations.

This guide to the collection, and to the Assyrian world in general, was first published in 1995 and is now available again.</p><p>John Curtis is Keeper of Special Middle East Projects at the British Museum and a Fellow of the British Academy. His personal research interests focus on the archaeology and history of Iraq and Iran, c.1000-330 BC. He is the author of a number of books including An Examination of Late Assyrian Metalwork, Ancient Persia, The Oxus Treasure, Forgotten Empire (with Nigel Tallis) and The Horse: From Arabia to Royal Ascot (with Nigel Tallis).What do you get when you combine the efforts of the British Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Abrams publishers, and the Assyrian Empire? An answer can be found in this wonderful new exhibit catalog filled with excellent color reproductions and a text that is both scholarly and readable. A chronology and list of kings help to keep track of people and events. Three chapters set up the history, civilization, and exploration of the Assyrian Empire; following chapters discuss and illustrate the art, dress, literature, government, religion, and war of that great civilization. Excellent photographs reproduce alabaster reliefs, ivory plaques, cyliner seals, and furniture with remarkable clarity. But this is more than a catalog of an art exhibit; it distills the Assyrian way of life for easy consumption. If you cannot get to New York, Ft. Worth, or London to see the traveling show, take a long look at this book; highly recommended.<br><i>Mary Morgan Smith, Northland P.L., Pittsburgh</i><br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>How Much Is a Million?</h2><p>Marvelosissimo the magician shows children how big the numbers million, billion, and trillion really are</p><p>This book reveals how big a bowl would be needed to hold a million goldfish, or how many years it would take to count to a million.<p>With the same energy, humor and clarity found in his 50 books, David wows audiences at schools around the United States and beyond.

But, because this fascinating man has always been so much more than a professional athlete, his long-awaited autobiography is vastly more than a book about winning and losing. Revealed with the unfailing candor and intensity that are his most distinctive personality traits, here are all of the Jack Nicklauses his legions of admirers, and even some of those close to him, have never known the son, whose eyes still well up at the mention of his father; the husband, deeply aware of how much the strength, resilience, charm, and love of a woman content to remain in the shadows have meant to both his public image and private happiness; the famous father who, every day of his life, really has put his children first; the artist, tirelessly creating highly acclaimed courses so that others can enjoy his beloved game; the businessman, staggeringly successful at times, staggeringly unsuccessful at others; the analyst of the methods and makeups of the golfers who pushed him hardest and, most candidly of his own strengths and weaknesses; the commentator offering deep insights and strong opinions on the whys and wherefores of an occupation that has been extremely rewarding for him, yet one that he still regards as purely a game; and the multimillionaire, jet-plane-owning, world-traveling celebrity who is happiest hanging around home in a pair of shorts, then taking the kids to a family restaurant for dinner.</p><p>As "The Golfer of the Century," Jack Nicklaus is a recognized authority on the game's history and direction, and in his 13th book, <i>My Story</i>, he shares the details of his most impressive victories. With 20 major championships under his belt, he has plenty of highlights to share, including shot-by-shot analyses of his classic battles with fellow legends Arnold Palmer, Gary Player, and Tom Watson. Indeed, Nicklaus seems to recall every shot of his illustrious career, and he is able to infuse his discussions of final round action with suspense, even though we've known the outcomes all these years. To this erudite study of golf the Golden Bear adds personal elements that reveal the man behind the one-iron. Nicklaus describes his business dealings--both successes and failures--his love of golf course design, the effects of celebrity status, and his childhood. Written with his longtime collaborator Ken Bowden, <i>My Story</i> is another eagle for the man whose name fills the record books.<b>Jack Nicklaus</b> was born in 1940 in Columbus, Ohio, and maintains a home there and in Florida. Widely regarded as the greatest golfer of all time, he has achieved a record twenty major championship victories, consisting of two U.S. Amateurs, six Masters (also a record), four U.S. Opens, three British Opens, and five PGA Championships. The winner of more than 100 professional tournaments around the world, Nicklaus was named Golfer of the Century in 1988.</p><h2>Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America</h2><p>For Rudolf Steiner, life can be truly understood only if it is experienced as art is experienced, as inner activities expressed through physical materials.

Struggling to settle into her latest job and home in Oxford, she realises she needs to effect a change if she&#x2019;s to create a meaningful life for herself, one that can accommodate comfort and labour and love. Then friends give her the gift of a colony of honeybees &#x2013; according to folklore, bees freely given bring luck &#x2013; and Helen embarks on her first full year of beekeeping.

Koestler affirms that all creatures have the capacity for creative activity, frequently suppressed by the automatic routines of thought and behavior that dominate their lives. The study of psychology has offered little in the way of an explanation of the creative process, and Koestler suggests that we are at our most creative when rational thought is suspended - for example in dreams and trance-like states. Then the mind is capable of receiving inspiration and insight.</p> <p>Taking humor as his starting point, Koestler examines what he terms 'bisociative' thinking - the creative leap made by the mind that gives rise to new and startling perceptions and glimpses of reality. From here he assesses the workings of the mind of the scientific or artistic genius. The general reader as well as the reader with a deeper knowledge of the topics covered will find this richly documented study of creativity both illuminating and compelling.</p></p><p></p><h2>Holiness: Its Nature, Hindrances, Difficulties, and Roots</h2><p>With his trademark candor, J.C.

Martyn Lloyd-Jones and an exhaustive index of Scripture.</p><p>J. C. RYLE (1816-1900) was appointed as the first bishop of Liverpool in 1880 and was the leader of the Evangelical Party in the Church of England for more than half a century. He is highly regarded for his plain and lively writings on practical and spiritual themes; their usefulness and impact have been consistently recognized and remain as wise and relevant today as when he first wrote them.&#39;...this book is simply the best of Ryle the Puritan-type pastor. Real Christians will find it a gold mine, a feast, a spur and a heart-warmer, food, drink, medicine, and a course of vitamins, all in one.&#39; --J.I. Packer</p><h2>In the Eye of the Storm</h2><p><p>Nearly forty years have passed since I began my first mission to Tonga. At the urging of many people whom I admire, I have attempted to describe some of the experiences and feelings I encountered those many years ago. The main purpose of this book is to emphasize the overwhelming need for faith in our lives.</p> <p>I realize that in some ways I am describing a time and a place and circumstances that no longer exist. Yet in other ways, I am describing feelings and challenges that are as old as time and as fresh as the morning sun. I am convinced that regardless of the physical background or the decade our life's experiences are cast against, the need for love and faith to bring meaning to our lives and reason for our decisions remains unchanged.</p> <p>I do not apologize for the time, the place, or the circumstances described, as that was the way it was. I suppose most people who have passed through this planet earth have lived and died closer to the type of life described herein than the hectic one we live in America today. We all need more faith, and I know we can learn from others.</p> <p>In looking back and reading letters and other items written at the time, I have tried to describe how I felt then. I had no feeling that I was going into a particularly hard situation or that things were going to be tough. I had no thought of doing anything unusual, but rather simply wanted to do my best to get through each day doing as much good and as little damage as possible.</p></p><p></p><h2>The Plea: A Novel (Eddie Flynn, 2)</h2><p><p><b>&#x201c;<i>The Plea</i> is one of the most purely entertaining books you'll read this year.

They set out to exaggerate and prolong the scandal, not merely to destroy Richard Nixon, but to undermine the entire Republican Party and pave the way for another Kennedy presidency in 1976.&nbsp;<br><br>In the process, working closely with a willing media, they pioneered the politics of personal destruction, which has tarnished our country ever since.&nbsp;<br><br>Shepard reveals how this Kennedy conspiracy included members and staffs of the Senate, the House, the Justice Department, and the Special Prosecutor&#x2019;s office. They used delay tactics and obfuscation to postpone the indictments and avoid trials of the handful of real Watergate criminals.&nbsp;<br><br>Shepard argues that the abuses of power by Kennedy&#x2019;s cronies dwarf those of the administration they savaged. Among those he singles out for reevaluation are Republican turncoat John Dean, Mark &#x201c;Deep Throat&#x201d; Felt, reporter Bob Woodward, and a young lawyer for the House Judiciary Committee named Hillary Rodham.</p><p><b>Geoff Shepard</b>&nbsp;worked in the Nixon White House for more than five years, first as a White House Fellow, then as a senior member of the Domestic Council staff. After leaving the Ford administration in 1975, he spent the next thirty years as a corporate lawyer, primarily in the insurance industry.Between John Dean&#x2019;s efforts to gain immunity from prosecution for his central involvement in the Watergate break-in and plot to cover it up and Ted Kennedy&#x2019;s efforts to redeem his political career after Chappaquiddick lies the real truth behind the Watergate scandal, alleges Shepard, a former Nixon White House staffer. Drawing on extensive research, Shepard contends that Kennedy used his subcommittee to begin an investigation and funnel information to the committee officially charged with looking into the Watergate scandal. Kennedy insiders were all part of a Camelot conspiracy to bring down President Nixon and harm the Republican Party to such an extent that Kennedy would be primed to win a bid for the presidency in 1976, alleges Shepard. Although Dean has come to be regarded as one of the heroes of the era, Shepard asserts that once Dean, the president&#x2019;s counsel, decided to aid the investigation, he became the villain, breaching attorney-client privilege and releasing government secrets. All the drama of Watergate is here: Deep Throat, the 18�-minute gap on the Nixon White House tapes, the Senate posturing, and the impeachment inquiry. Shepard is thorough in his research and passionate in his viewpoints but has no compunction about imagining events and motivations when they are not documented and is reluctant to provide facts and let readers come to their own conclusions. Still, Shepard brings back vivid memories of an acrimonious time and raises some interesting questions. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>Money With A Mission</h2><p>Money Is for Movement!What are your plans for your money?

Ice Age Mammals of North America transports you to the world of saber-tooth cats, woolly mammoths, four-hundred-pound beavers, and twenty-foot-tall ground sloths.

This simple act of reconnecting with children with nature is Sharon Lovejoy's purpose and joy and gift. Author of <i>Sunflower Houses: Garden Discoveries for Children of All Ages </i>and <i>Hollyhock Days: Garden Adventures for the Young at Heart</i>, Sharon Lovejoy is a nationally known garden writer whose books, television specials, and projects at her learning landscape in California have introduced thousands of children to the pleasures of gardening.<br><br>In her newest book, <i>Roots, Shoots, Buckets &amp; Boots</i>, she presents 12 spirited, easy-to-implement ideas for theme gardens that parents and kids can grow together. Illustrated throughout by the author's own lyrical watercolors, each garden includes a plan, the planting recipe -- seeds, seedlings, and growing instructions spelled out step-by-step -- and activities. There's the Pizza Patch , a giant-size wheel garden planted in "slices" of tomatoes, zucchini, oregano, and basil. A Flowery Maze to get lost in. A Moon Garden of night-blooming flowers, including a moonflower tent. And Mother Nature's Medicine Chest.<br><br>Discovery Walks teach kids how the gardens work, and a chapter on gardening basics includes a child-friendly 10-Minute Plan for planting and maintenance, plus a list of the top 20 plants guaranteed to make gardeners out of kids.</p><p>Green thumbs and non-green thumbs alike will fall in love with <i>Roots, Shoots, Buckets, &amp; Boots</i>, a remarkably fun and informative introduction to the wonderful world of gardening--and more specifically, gardening with children. Learn how to make everything from a pizza garden (pizza-pie-shaped, with herbs and vegetables for a fabulous pizza at harvest time), to a sunflower house (a secret hideaway with stately sunflowers and lovely creeping morning glories), to a moon garden ("Fragrance is the color of night"). Chock full of helpful hints, clever and artistic touches, and intriguing "recipes" (Moth Broth and Compost Sandwich, to name a few), this idea book will spark creativity and a lifelong fascination with gardening. Nine concepts for theme gardens are presented in a clearly defined yet non-rigid manner that is just right for encouraging young gardeners. Sharon Lovejoy, award-winning author and illustrator of several gardening books, including <i>Hollyhock Days: Garden Adventures for the Young at Heart</i>, has a true knack for working with all kinds of living things, including children. She understands how quickly young people will be turned off by inflexible rules, and instead encourages budding green thumbs to experiment and explore, while providing them with useful guidelines and helpful information. Wonderfully earthy watercolors make this cozy book even more welcoming. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>In the introduction, it states, "Although these gardens are filled with edible plants, not all parts of every plant are edible. For example, while potatoes and tomatoes are edible, their stem, flowers, and leaves are poisonous. Teach your kids never to sample anything in their gardens until they check with you." <p>While anything in nature may be a "potential natural hazard," the degree of hazard depends on the concentration, which is beyond the scope of this book.

For decades after the medium's birth, it was free of organized critical analysis, its creators generally disinclined to self-analysis or formal documentation. The average reader didn't know who created the comics, how or why . . . and except for a uniquely destructive period during America's witch-hunting of the 1950s, didn't seem to care. As the medium has matured, however, and the creativity of comics began to touch the mainstream of popular culture in many ways, curiosity followed, leading to journalism and eventually, scholarship, and so here we are." </p><p><i>The Power of Comics</i> is the first introductory textbook for comic art studies courses. Lending a broader understanding of the medium and its communication potential, it provides students with a coherent and comprehensive explanation of comic books and graphic novels, including coverage of their history and their communication techniques, research into their meanings and effects and an overview of industry practices and fan culture. </p><p>Co-authors randy Duncan and Matthew J. Smith draw on their own years of experience teaching comics studies courses and the scholarly literature across several disciplines to create a text with the following features: </p><p>� Discussion questions for each chapter </p><p>� Activities to engage readers </p><p>� Recommended reading suggestions </p><p>� Over 150 illustrations </p><p>� Bibliography </p><p>� Glossary </p><p><i>The Power of Comics</i> deals exclusively with comic books and graphic novels. One reason for this focus is that no one text can hope to do justice to both strips and books; there is simply too much to cover. Preference is given to comic books because in their longer form, the graphic novel, they have the greatest potential for depth and complexity of expression. As comic strips shrink in size and become more inane in content, comic books are becoming a serious art form.</p></p><p><p>Dr. Randy Duncan is a co-founder the Comic Arts Conference, the nation's first annual academic conference devoted solely to the study of comics. He also wrote the entries on Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Will Eisner and other comics-related topics for the <i>St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture.</i></p>"[The Power of Comics] includes a broad range of topics, from the history of comic books to comprehension of the medium, to creators and fandom.<br>As a textbook, it succeeds in content, scope, and execution.

I have used The Power of Comics as a text for a comic book course and found that though students lament that it's not a comic book (a la Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics), they most certainly take extensive value from it. McCloud's text is useful and a great compliment but even McCloud notes that his book is just the opening volley on discussions about comics, whereas Duncan and Smith further develop that discussion some fifteen years after the publication of Understanding Comics. Their chapter topics, overall approach, and extensive use of scholarship and academic jargon broken down into layman's terms really do allow for neophyte and fanboy alike to fully understand the "power of comics."

Up to this point in time I did not have a singlerecommendation, but now I can direct them to this new volume by Duncanand Smith, who are right-up-front about the objective of their book inthe first line of their Preface &#x2014; "This is a textbook about comics."<br><br>The layout of this book is well-matched to today's visually astutestudent. It provides a good balance of text and image and is dividedinto 13 chapters, including topics such as "Comic Book Creators," and"The Comic Book Industry."What is immediately evident from the layoutis the explicit educational focus on the material. Each chapter openswith a thought provoking or, in some instances, amusing excerpt from agroup of esoteric authorities including literary critics, historians,poets, and theorists, followed by a short anecdote related to thetopic. Chapter objectives are stated plainly with an assertive headingthat reads, "In this chapter, you will learn." For example, in thechapter, "Comic Books and Ideology," two of the four objectives include"the concept of ideology and the reason for exploring its function insociety"; and "some ways in which comics creators have taken up socialcauses in opposition to prevailing ideologies." There are over 150black and white illustrations to clarify the various concepts andhistorical references. Another feature is their choice of illustrationsthat not only include familiar classics but also a rich variety ofcontemporary comics by David Lapham (Stray Bullets), Seth (Palooka-Ville), Craig Thompson (Blankets),and others. Additionally, visual interest is kept alive with boxedsidebars broken up into "Profiles" and "Discovering" sections thatinclude more detailed information related to the topics. Examplesinclude profiles of comics creator Jack Kirby and DC Executive EditorKaren Berger, as well as essays such as the "Discovering: Milestones inthe Development of Comics Art Studies," and "Discovering:<br>Comic Book Advertising."<br><br>What I found especially provocative were the "Discussion Questions" and"Activities" sections at the end of each chapter that frame the topicsinto constructive learning models that encourage critical thinking. Ifound these elements particularly useful and a credit to each author'sunderstanding and presentation of the material and concepts, inaddition to their obvious teaching skills. The recommended readings ineach chapter are separated into "Comics" and "Scholarly Sources," withhelpful annotations for further investigation.<br><br>Finally, an extensive glossary is provided from terms convenientlydisplayed in bold throughout the text.

Although theauthors admit the minor coverage of international comics in thisvolume, with only one short chapter covering this topic, their bookserves its purpose.

You are not alone. It turns out our brains are hard-wired to make poor financial and life decisions. <i>Financial Intelligence</i> helps you break the cycle of habitual and emotional decision-making that hard-wiring automatically sparks when faced with emotionally charged events. Beginning with your principles, values, and beliefs, <i>Financial Intelligence</i> offers a concrete guide to help you achieve better results. Doug Lennick provides a simple and clear four-step method, known as the 4Rs, for making wise financial and life decisions based on your core values. When you find yourself in a highly charged event, such as the Dow Jones plummeting, rash decisions often follow like selling out your entire stock portfolio at record lows! Recognizing your automatic mental and physical responses is half the battle toward taking control of the situation. After reflecting on your values and your circumstances (while accounting for your inherent biases), you can reframe a more realistic interpretation of what is happening and what lies ahead. This allows you to respond to a critical situation with an understanding of it and foresight about which current actions will best serve your future goals. Accepting the certainty of uncertainty means you must prepare for the ups and downs of life so when you are thrown a curve ball you are confident you have the foundation in place to act wisely. <i>Financial Intelligence</i> gives you the tools to build this foundation to be able to step back from a tense situation, return to your core values, and transition to an emotional state where decisions are based on thoughtful analysis of what will bring you the greatest long-term success and fulfillment in life.</p><p>Doug Lennick, CFP�, is co-author with Fred Kiel, Ph.D., of the internationally successful book <i>Moral Intelligence: Enhancing Business Performance and Leadership Success</i> (2005 and re-released 2008, Wharton School Publishing), as well as author of <i>The Simple Genius (You)</i> and co-author with Roy Geer, Ph.D., of <i>How to Get What You Want and Remain True to Yourself.</i> Doug is in high demand as a keynote speaker as well as an executive and organizational adviser.

Follow him on Twitter @GraemeSimsion.</p>The Rosie Effect one<p></p> <br>Orange juice was not scheduled for Fridays. Although Rosie and I had abandoned the Standardized Meal System, resulting in an improvement in &#x201c;spontaneity&#x201d; at the expense of shopping time, food inventory, and wastage, we had agreed that each week should include three alcohol-free days. Without formal scheduling, this target proved difficult to achieve, as I had predicted. Rosie eventually saw the logic of my solution.<br> <br>Fridays and Saturdays were obvious days on which to consume alcohol. Neither of us had classes on the weekend. We could sleep late and possibly have sex.<br> <br>Sex was absolutely not allowed to be scheduled, at least not by explicit discussion, but I had become familiar with the sequence of events likely to precipitate it: a blueberry muffin from Blue Sky Bakery, a triple shot of espresso from Otha&#x2019;s, removal of my shirt, and my impersonation of Gregory Peck in the role of Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. I had learned not to do all four in the same sequence on every occasion, as my intention would then be obvious. To provide an element of unpredictability, I settled on tossing a coin twice to select a component of the routine to delete.<br> <br>I had placed a bottle of Elk Cove pinot gris in the refrigerator to accompany the divers&#x2019; scallops purchased that morning at Chelsea Market, but when I returned after retrieving our laundry from the basement, there were two glasses of orange juice on the table. Orange juice was not compatible with the wine. Drinking it first would desensitize our taste buds to the slight residual sugar that was a feature of the pinot gris, thus creating an impression of sourness. Waiting until after we had finished the wine would also be unacceptable. Orange juice deteriorates rapidly&#x2014;hence the emphasis placed by breakfast establishments on &#x201c;freshly squeezed.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rosie was in the bedroom, so not immediately available for discussion. In our apartment, there were nine possible combinations of locations for two people, of which six involved us being in different rooms. In our ideal apartment, as jointly specified prior to our arrival in New York, there would have been thirty-six possible combinations, arising from the bedroom, two studies, two bathrooms, and a living-room-kitchen. This reference apartment would have been located in Manhattan, close to the 1 or A train for access to Columbia University medical school, with water views and a balcony or rooftop barbecue area.<br> <br>As our income consisted of one academic&#x2019;s salary, supplemented by two part-time cocktail-making jobs but reduced by Rosie&#x2019;s tuition fees, some compromise was required, and our apartment offered none of the specified features. We had given excessive weight to the Williamsburg location because our friends Isaac and Judy Esler lived there and had recommended it. There was no logical reason why a (then) forty-year-old professor of genetics and a thirty-year-old postgraduate medical student would be suited to the same neighborhood as a fifty-four-year-old psychiatrist and a fifty-two-year-old potter who had acquired their dwelling before prices escalated. The rent was high and the apartment had a number of faults that the management was reluctant to rectify. Currently the air-conditioning was failing to compensate for the exterior temperature of thirty-four degrees Celsius, which was within the expected range for Brooklyn in late June.<br> <br>The reduction in room numbers, combined with marriage, meant I had been thrown into closer sustained proximity with another human being than ever before. Rosie&#x2019;s physical presence was a hugely positive outcome of the Wife Project, but after ten months and ten days of marriage I was still adapting to being a component of a couple. I sometimes spent longer in the bathroom than was strictly necessary.<br> <br>I checked the date on my phone&#x2014;definitely Friday, June 21. This was a better outcome than the scenario in which my brain had developed a fault that caused it to identify days incorrectly. But it confirmed a violation of the alcohol protocol.<br> <br>My reflections were interrupted by Rosie emerging from the bedroom wearing only a towel. This was my favorite costume, assuming &#x201c;no costume&#x201d; did not qualify as a costume. Once again, I was struck by her extraordinary beauty and inexplicable decision to select me as her partner. And, as always, that thought was followed by an unwanted emotion: an intense moment of fear that she would one day realize her error.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s cooking?&#x201d; she asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing. Cooking has not commenced. I&#x2019;m in the ingredient-assembly phase.&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughed, in the tone that indicated I had misinterpreted her question. Of course, the question would not have been required at all had the Standardized Meal System been in place. I provided the information that I guessed Rosie was seeking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sustainable scallops with a mirepoix of carrots, celeriac, shallots, and bell peppers and a sesame oil dressing. The recommended accompanying beverage is pinot gris.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you need me to do anything?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We all need to get some sleep tonight. Tomorrow we go to Navarone.&#x201d;<br> <br>The content of the Gregory Peck line was irrelevant. The effect came entirely from the delivery and the impression it conveyed of leadership and confidence in the preparation of saut�ed scallops.<br> <br>&#x201c;And what if I can&#x2019;t sleep, Captain?&#x201d; said Rosie. She smiled and disappeared into the bathroom. I did not raise the towel-location issue: I had long ago accepted that hers would be stored randomly in the bathroom or bedroom, effectively occupying two spaces.<br> <br>Our preferences for order are at different ends of the scale. When we moved from Australia to New York, Rosie packed three maximum-size suitcases. The quantity of clothes alone was incredible. My own personal items fitted into two carry-on bags. I took advantage of the move to upgrade my living equipment and gave my stereo and desktop computer to my brother, Trevor, returned the bed, linen, and kitchen utensils to the family home in Shepparton, and sold my bike.<br> <br>In contrast, Rosie added to her vast collection of possessions by purchasing decorative objects within weeks of our arrival. The result was evident in the chaotic condition of our apartment: potted plants, surplus chairs, and an impractical wine rack.<br> <br>It was not merely the quantity of items: there was also a problem of organization. The refrigerator was crowded with half-empty containers of bread toppings, dips, and decaying dairy products. Rosie had even suggested sourcing a second refrigerator from my friend Dave. One fridge each! Never had the advantages of the Standardized Meal System, with its fully specified meal for each day of the week, standard shopping list, and optimized inventory, been so obvious.<br> <br>There was exactly one exception to Rosie&#x2019;s disorganized approach. That exception was a variable. By default it was her medical studies, but currently it was her PhD thesis on environmental risks for the early onset of bipolar disorder. She had been granted advanced status in the Columbia MD program on the proviso that her thesis would be completed during the summer vacation. The deadline was now only two months and five days away.<br> <br>&#x201c;How can you be so organized at one thing and so disorganized at everything else?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d asked Rosie, following her installation of the incorrect driver for her printer.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s because I&#x2019;m concentrating on my thesis, I don&#x2019;t worry about other stuff. Nobody asks if Freud checked the use-by date on the milk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They didn&#x2019;t have use-by dates in the early twentieth century.&#x201d;<br> <br>It was incredible that two such dissimilar people had become a successful couple.</p><h2>Survival Medicine: Handbook That Will Save Your Life In The Wilderness: (Prepper&#39;s Guide, Survival Guide, Alternative Medicine, Emergency)</h2><p><p><b>Getting Your FREE Bonus</b></p> <p>Download this book, read it to the end and see <strong>"BONUS: Your FREE Gift"</strong> chapter after the conclusion.</p> <p><b>Survival Medicine: (FREE Bonus Included)</b></p> <p><b>Handbook That Will Save Your Life In The Wilderness</b></p> <p>Survival is a big concern for everyone in today&#x2019;s world.

In a career beginning shortly after she graduated from Gettysburg College in 1970, Springer wrote for ten years in the imaginary realms of mythological fantasy, then ventured on contemporary fantasy, magical realism, and women's fiction before turning her attention to children's literature. Her novels and stories for middle-grade and young adults range from contemporary realism, mystery/crime, and fantasy to her critically acclaimed novels based on the Arthurian mythos, I AM MORDRED: A TALE OF CAMELOT and I AM MORGAN LE FAY. Springer's children's books have won her two Edgar Allan Poe awards, a Carolyn W. Field award, various Children's Choice honors and numerous ALA Best Book listings. Her most recent series include the Tales of Rowan Hood, featuring Robin Hood&#x2019;s daughter, and the Enola Holmes mysteries, starring the much younger sister of Sherlock Holmes.<p> Ms. Springer lives in East Berlin, Pennsylvania. </p>Grade 5-7-It has been nearly a year since Princess Ettarde escaped from a fancy carriage to the cover of Sherwood Forest to avoid an arranged marriage. She has been happy living as Etty, one of the band of Rowan Hood, until her father and his troops arrive and place her thinly clad mother in a gilded cage to lure Etty back to her regal life. The teen dearly loves her mother, and resists the urge to flee. With her friends in the Rowan band as well as the help of Robin Hood and some of his men, she works through a clever plan to resolve this crisis. King Solon has given his daughter a good education in Greek philosophy, which she puts to use in confronting him, and applies her skills as a logician in many situations in the story. There is conflict and action from cover to cover as characters ply their varied skills to achieve goals and live life on their own terms, in a beautifully depicted forest setting. Fans of the series will enjoy this third installment; while new readers may be puzzled by references to past events, and will not fully understand the characters, they should still find the story satisfying.<br><i>Laura Scott, Farmington Community Library, MI</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Emperor of Scent : A Story of Perfume, Obsession and the Last Mystery of the Senses</h2><p>Luca Turin was born with an uncannily powerful nose, able to distinguish the components of any scent, from the world&#39;s most refined perfumes to the air on the New York subways. A scientist, he kept his powers to himself, concentrating on other fields. But when, for the love of it, he began to write reviews of fragrances, and those reviews took the world by storm, everything changed. The secret world of scent creation opened up, and Turin discovered something astonishing: No one understands how our noses work. Billions and billions of dollars are spent creating the scents all around us in a manner that amounts to a glorified trial and error. The solution to the mystery of every other human sense had led to a Nobel Prize. Why should smell be any different? Turin has given his life to this great riddle. And in the end, incredibly, after an epic struggle, he solved it. Then things got really interesting...Chandler Burr tells the extraordinary story of Luca Turin, his incredible sense of smell and his battles with the scientific establishment in as a remarkable quirky a tale of obsession as Susan Orlean&#39;s bestseller &#34;The Orchid Thief&#34;.</p><p>For as long as anyone can remember, a man named Luca Turin has had an uncanny relationship with smells. He has been compared to the hero of Patrick S�skind&#x2019;s novel <b>Perfume</b>, but his story is in fact stranger, because it is true. It concerns how he made use of his powerful gifts to solve one of the last great mysteries of the human body: how our noses work.<br><br>Luca Turin can distinguish the components of just about any smell, from the world&#x2019;s most refined perfumes to the air in a subway car on the Paris metro. A distinguished scientist, he once worked in an unrelated field, though he made a hobby of collecting fragrances. But when, as a lark, he published a collection of his reviews of the world&#x2019;s perfumes, the book hit the small, insular business of perfume makers like a thunderclap. Who is this man Luca Turin, they demanded, and how does he know so much? The closed community of scent creation opened up to Luca Turin, and he discovered a fact that astonished him: no one in this world knew how smell worked. Billions and billions of dollars were spent creating scents in a manner amounting to glorified trial and error.<br><br>The solution to the mystery of every other human sense has led to the Nobel Prize, if not vast riches. Why, Luca Turin thought, should smell be any different? So he gave his life to this great puzzle. And in the end, incredibly, it would seem that he solved it. But when enormously powerful interests are threatened and great reputations are at stake, Luca Turin learned, nothing is quite what it seems.<br><br>Acclaimed writer Chandler Burr has spent four years chronicling Luca Turin&#x2019;s quest to unravel the mystery of how our sense of smell works. What has emerged is an enthralling, magical book that changes the way we think about that area between our mouth and our eyes, and its profound, secret hold on our lives."A brilliant, feisty scientist at the center of a nasty, back-stabbing, utterly absorbing, cliff-hanging scramble for the Nobel Prize.&nbsp; <b>The Emperor of Scent</b> is a quirky, wonderful book."&nbsp; <br>-<b>John Berendt</b>, author of <b>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil<br></b><br>"Professional perfume critic, obsessive collector of rare fragrances, academic-bad-boy biochemist and world-class eccentric, Luca Turin would be the worthy subject of a book even if he hadn't come up with a revolutionary scientific theory. Written with skill and verve,<i> </i><b>The Emperor of Scent</b> is an engrossing intellectual detective story about one iconoclast's quest to solve a centuries-old mystery--how smell works."<b><br></b>-<b>Miles Harvey</b>, author of <b>The Island of Lost Maps </b><br><br>"<b>The Emperor of Scent</b> is a gem of a book--a suspense story at whose heart is a man of super-human powers who is also flawed and justifiably arrogant and dangerously steeped in hubris. I challenge any intelligent, curious mind not to tumble into this story and find themselves immediately engrossed. I fell in love with Luca Turin--he is everything I admire in a human: irreverent, witty, imaginative, determined, elitist without a trace of snobbery and above all a creative genius. And Chandler Burr is a magician himself, and a man we should all be so lucky to have at a dinner party: I was mesmerized and enlightened by the many perfect asides woven into the main body of this incredible true tale."<br>-<b>Alexandra Fuller</b>, author of <b>Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight</b></p><h2>Martha Rosler: Irrespective</h2><p>The work of Martha Rosler&nbsp;is perennially incisive, provocative, political, and timely, exploring a range of issues from everyday life and the media to architecture and the built environment, especially as they affect women. Over her prolific career, Rosler has returned to themes of social justice, popular culture, food, gardens and the natural world, and the intersection of aesthetics and ethics. <i>Martha Rosler: Irrespective</i> is the only survey of the artist&#x2019;s vital and enduring work, examining it across media including photocollage, video and film, installation, actions, and books. In addition to a rich array of artworks, this book presents texts by distinguished critics and art historians, and a candid and insightful conversation with the artist. Through her interrogations of the Vietnam War, the War on Terror, feminism,&nbsp;gentrification, and other timely issues, Rosler has persistently bridged art and activism. This important catalogue comes at a moment when work like Rosler&#x2019;s has the power to inspire change.</p><p>The politically engaged work of Martha Rosler is fascinating and provocative; this wide-ranging survey brings timely insights at a moment of resurgence for political activism and feminism.<p><b>Martha Rosler</b> is an artist based in New York and is on the visual arts faculty at the Mason Gross School of the Arts of Rutgers University. </p></p><h2>Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1945-1956</h2><p><p>In the long-awaited National Book Award--shortlisted follow-up to her Pulitzer Prize--winning&nbsp;<i>Gulag</i>, acclaimed journalist Anne Applebaum delivers a groundbreaking history of how Communism took over Central Europe after WW II and transformed in frightening fashion the individuals who came under its sway.<br>&nbsp;<br>At the end of WW II, the Soviet Union, to its surprise and delight, found itself in control of a huge swath of territory in Central Europe. It set out to convert a dozen radically different countries to a completely new political and moral system: Communism.&nbsp;<i>Iron Curtain</i>&nbsp;describes how the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe were created, and what daily life was like once they were completed. Applebaum draws on newly opened European archives and personal accounts translated for the first time to portray in devastating detail millions of individuals trying to adjust to a way of life that challenged their every belief, rendered worthless their every qualification, and took away everything they had accumulated. Today the Soviet Bloc is a lost civilization, one whose cruelty, paranoia, bizarre morality and strange aethestics Applebaum captures in the electrifying pages of this book.<br>&nbsp;</p></p><p>ANNE APPLEBAUM is a columnist for the <i>Washington Post </i>and <i>Slate.</i> Her previous book, <i>Gulag</i>, won the Pulitzer Prize for nonfiction and was a finalist for three other major prizes.

Three-quarters of a century later, the &#x201c;look&#x201d; of the new remains indebted to the Bauhaus and its equation of technology with modernism. Central to discussions of the relationships between art, industrialization, and politics in the twentieth century, much of the school&#x2019;s later impact was derived in part from its status as one of the foremost cultural symbols of Germany&#x2019;s first democracy and its public reputation as a &#x201c;cathedral of socialism.&#x201d; <br><br>In this book, editor Kathleen James-Chakraborty and seven other scholars analyze the accomplishments and dispel the myths of the Bauhaus, placing it firmly in a historical context from before the formation of the Weimar Republic through Nazi ascendancy and World War II into the cold war. Together, they investigate its professors&#x2019; and students&#x2019; interactions with mass culture; establish the complexity of its relationship with Wilhelmine, Nazi, and postwar German politics; and challenge the claim that its architects greatly influenced American architecture in the 1930s. <br><br>Their most explosive conclusions address the degree to which some aspects of Bauhaus design continued to flourish during the Third Reich before becoming one of the cold war&#x2019;s most enduring emblems of artistic freedom. In doing so, <i>Bauhaus Culture</i> calls into question the degree to which this influential school should continue to symbolize an uncomplicated relationship between art, modern technology, and progressive politics. <br><br>Contributors: Greg Castillo, Juliet Koss, Rose-Carol Washton Long, John V.

In addition, he has been selected by the Robert B. Parker estate to continue the Spenser novels, the first of which, <i>Robert B. Parker&#x2019;s Lullaby</i>, was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller. He lives on a farm outside Oxford, Mississippi.<br>In Tampa in 1955, a time of Cuban neighborhoods and cigar factories, Sicilian and Cuban gangsters competed to control the city's illicit activities. One of the most colorful characters was Charlie Wall, a crime boss and political operative. His assassination by a pair of thugs is the starting point of this novel, closely based on fact. William Dufris gives some figures slight vocal characterizations, which help identify characters in passages of extended dialogue. At the close of the book there are fascinating interviews with the author, the first reporter on the murder scene, a sheriff's officer at the time, and the police interview with the prime suspect, "Scarface" Johnny Rivera. These added features are a true bonus.

Woolf, a major modernist writer and critic, takes us on an erudite yet conversational--and completely entertaining--walk around the history of women in writing, smoothly comparing the architecture of sentences by the likes of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, all the while lampooning the chauvinistic state of university education in the England of her day. When she concluded that to achieve their full greatness as writers women will need a solid income and a privacy, Woolf pretty much invented modern feminist criticism.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

But a shadow is cast over proceedings when a shocking murder takes place during the performance - a murder which strangely echoes a tragedy that occurred many years before. For Flavia, undoing the complex knot that ties these strands together will test her precocious powers of deduction to the limit - and throw a revealing light into some of the darker corners of the adult world...</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: An Essay by Alan Bradley</strong> <br> <p> </p><p>Flavia de Luce walked into my life one winter day, parked herself on a campstool, and refused to be budged.</p> <p>It took me quite a while to realize that she wasn&#x2019;t even faintly interested in the mystery novel I was attempting to write at the time: the one into which she had wandered. I found out quickly enough that Flavia wanted her own book--and that was that.</p> <p>And it was just the beginning. There were still more problems to come.</p> <p>The first was this: Flavia lived in 1950, while I was writing about her in 2006 and 2007.</p> <p>As an author, it&#x2019;s not as easy as you might think projecting--and keeping--your mind in a different century from your body--not without forever being yanked back into the present by everyday annoyances such as frozen water pipes, expiring license plates, incessantly barking dogs, and the need to shop for food.</p> <p>Another problem was this: I lived on Canada&#x2019;s west coast, where the clocks are set to Pacific Time, while Flavia lived in Bishop&#x2019;s Lacey, England, which is on Greenwich Mean Time--a difference of nine hours. In practical terms, this meant that Flavia was raring to go every day just as I was getting ready for bed. Because there was no point in either of us being tired and cranky, we finally managed to work out a compromise in which I began awakening at 4:00 a.m. to write, while Flavia (rather impatiently) hung around until after lunch, waiting for me to show up.</p> <p>As <i>The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie</i> progressed, I soon learned that Flavia wouldn&#x2019;t be pushed around--especially by me. Because she had so many of her own ideas, she had little patience with mine. Occasionally, if I were tired, I&#x2019;d find myself trying to put words in her mouth: to push her, as it were. But Flavia would have none of it.</p> <p>"Blot that," she seemed to be saying. "Let&#x2019;s back up and start again."</p> <p>And of course we did.</p> <p>Then there was the problem of the chemistry. While Flavia knew everything about chemistry that could be known, my own knowledge of the subject could be put into a thimble with room left over for a finger. If I protested that I was in doubt about the precise details of one of her more bizarre chemical experiments, Flavia would snap her metaphorical fingers and say, "Well, you can look it up in your spare time."</p> <p>Almost from the outset I realized that the tale Flavia had to tell could never be contained in a single book. And that&#x2019;s how the series was born. Fortunately, my editors were in total agreement!</p> <p>We liked the idea of each book revolving around some now-vanished English custom, or way of life, and of being able, gradually, to get to know the de Luce family, giving each of them the time and the space to--eventually--tell his or her own story.</p> <p>Of course, to convey authentic 1950s voices, the pacing would have to be slower than we are used to in the 21st century. On the other hand, a more relaxed narrative would allow for an additional overall richness of description that might not be found in a more breakneck series of thrillers.</p> <p>But I needn&#x2019;t have worried: Flavia had her own voice and insisted on being listened to.</p> <p>It was I who had to do the learning. <em>--Alan Bradley</em></p> <p>(Photo � Shirley Bradley)</p>Alan Bradley was born into a family of storytellers who never stopped talking about the old days &#39;back home&#39; in England - for which he is eternally grateful.

Volkman, a former Newsday correspondent, and Cummings, a reporter for that Long Island newspaper, spent seven years searching out details of the complicated case. The principals included James Burke, a sinister bar owner with direct ties to the Mafia, many of his hangers-on and two Lufthansa employees who had conceived a plan for the crime but lacked the underworld contacts to carry it out. The robbery went off almost without a hitch, although the two airline workers were suspected from the start. As the skein unraveled, more gang members were identified, but Burke could not be arrested because he had all the underlingshis potential accuserskilled, the death toll finally reaching 13. The story is well told, although the authors sometimes employ a light tone that seems inappropriate tothe bloody story they tell. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The Heist is a popularly written account of the 1978 Lufthansa Air Cargo holdup at Kennedy Airport, which netted three times more cash than the celebrated Brink's robbery nearly 30 years before.

An outstanding example of late medieval manuscript art, it was written and illuminated in the early 15th century for John, Duke of Bedford, younger brother of King Henry V, and his wife, Anne of Burgundy. The principal artist of the leading Parisian workshop in which it was produced takes his name, the &#34;Bedford Master,&#34; from his English patron. Expertly planned and professionally executed, the Bedford Hours is celebrated for the enormous range of its pictorial scheme, with many superb large miniatures in brilliant colours, and almost 1250 exquisite marginal details.

She died in 2016.1<br><br> Sister Blendina was playing solitaire. I didn't know it at the time and I was wearing Dogsbody, so I swivel up to the counter with my brights on and smile a hot "cash-my-check-big-daddy-you-never-know" at the cashier. He reaches for me and I get ready to scratch his palm with my thumbnail as I hand him the check. Then there's something between his hand and Dogsbody mine and his fingers are wrapping around a brown plastic knob on a metal box and twisting-the volume comes on full. The timing is all mixed up and everything is happening much too fast all around me. The manager comes running up and examines the check and pinches old Dogsbody's arm and makes phone calls and asks my real name and address and all the time with his best Kresge's five-and-dime leer and waving toward the door as a crisp blue uniform comes two-timing through it. I stand musing in the midst of the lost Missouri slow and try to answer (the truth about my name and something else for my address&#x2014;I live at 319 Liberty Street, Independence Mo.) to the uniform's eyes. It hits me too late that the rules for a straightforward-gaze-into-another's-eyes are radically altered when the other's-eyes are dangling on a chain on either side of his fly.<br> &nbsp;<br> Seven miles away and twelve stories up Sister Blendina turns up a black ace and the eyes begin to move and grow. At that point I try to slip out of Dogsbody the back way but it's a close fit and they're too fast for me. The uniform takes one long fast step that puts him behind me. That gives the eyes time to become metal rings opened wide and moving in quickly each one closing with a hard click around one of my thighs an inch below the crotch. My stomach drops and would fall but it catches on my crotch and is saved (familiar fast elevator sensation like when Mama calls your name in that voice that means she's going to make you lie down and spread your legs to make certain your new daddy hasn't been diddling four-year-old you while she shopped). I clench my legs, and the heat fuses the two rings together where they touch between my legs. I'm instantly crippled-able to walk but not fast and all from the knee. Unable to escape from Dogsbody with the rear exit blocked. The gambit is a success but the uniform whips his fly open to make sure. The laser gun inside snaps up on a powerful spring mechanism. The uniform tightens his butt muscles and throws his pelvis forward. He bumps and grinds behind me-each movement activating the laser. The light pulses spray over me with a one-in-three red Kresge neon tracer for accuracy. I can feel Dogsbody sinking down over me in a puddle and the Kresge air is blowing in through the holes onto bare me. By the time he stops Dogsbody is limp. He tucks the gun back between his legs (tenderly 'cause it's hot) and zips up. Meanwhile I'm whispering frantically to Dogsbody trying to reactivate her: "Puberty!" (her Christian name) "Puberty." In my urgency I even summon up the old Moon incantation:<br> &nbsp;<br> Abra Cadabra<br> Peanut butter sam<br> Pickle in the middle<br> Catch me if you can!<br> &nbsp;<br> When done properly this chant builds from a s�ance whisper to a derisive howl and never fails to rouse Dogsbody. I can't give it the full whammy in front of the uniform so when it doesn't work I just have to go on without her help. The uniform gives me a shove toward the door and I just have time to pooch out tits where they would be if Dogsbody were on the job before we're moving. He puts his lover arm-like around me except where my shoulder is twisted to just before breaking. So we walk out the door&#x2014;me hobbling along with the thigh-links working and Dogsbody just tatters flipping around me in the breeze.<br> &nbsp;<br> Truck-truck-trucka-truck-whoosh! Out of the red Christmas Kresge's into the diffuse Muzak of the carillon bells in the square. We find a fat November Independence swarming.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lots of lovers fucka-trucking down the street just like us. Lot of pinching and nuzzling and fondling going on. I kind of wrap D.B. remnants around me closer and snuggle up to the uniform so as not to be conspicuous. He bends down and nibbles at my ear and says "If you try to run I'll shoot you dead." I can feel his groin gun nudging me in the butt with every step and I know he's telling the truth. I smile up at him all cozy but I catch him chewing a bloody chunk of my earlobe and look away embarrassed.<br> &nbsp;<br> The courthouse sits in the middle of the square. On the courthouse lawn is a merry-go-round. I see it just as we tum the corner and start poking out of Dogsbody in big patches. "Wow! Do I love merry-go-rounds!"<br> &nbsp;<br> The uniform shows me his teeth and the volume goes up again. We're almost up to the crowd and Strauss waltzes are whipping in and out of the bells. Long lines of little boys and girls-each pulling a parent coil around the merry-go-round and the two little booths in front of it. They have to pass the booths to get to the horses. All the little boys are dragging Mommies, the little girls are dragging Daddies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In front of the booth marked BOYS are three six-year-olds firing bows and arrows at their Mommies who are perched on benches inside with their legs spread wide. They each have four chances to get an arrow to the point where the legs begin from fifteen child paces. Daddies are sitting in the other booth while their little girls throw hoops over their wienies. If they don't make it in four tries they can't ride the merry-go-round so the Mommies spread their legs wider and wider and the Daddies sweat to rub up a good one.<br> &nbsp;<br> A little blond girl begins to cry because her Daddy was so soft that the hoops slipped off. He blushes and tries to bribe the barker to let her on the horses anyway but he just gets a show of teeth.<br> &nbsp;<br> Oh my! the merry-go-round! Forty horses with fierce white eyes and lips pulled back&#x2014;tails and manes lifted by the wind that blew through the carver's fingers.<br> &nbsp;<br> Riveted between each pair of carved rear legs a hard pink plastic wienie-eternally erect-bored in the ancient wood high up under each tail-a hole-deep and thickly lined with plastic sponge. Below each wienie a platform fixed to the floor-behind each hole a small seat hung from the ceiling.<br> &nbsp;<br> But that's all me poking through&#x2014;Dogsbody would point out that: As we approach the merry-go-round is stopped&#x2014;waiting for a new load&#x2014;the Strauss waltzes are still playing, the horses are still leaping but frozen in place. Between the time when my right foot leaves the ground in walking and comes down short because of the thigh-links a thousand incarnations pass in which the only movement is the merry-go-round keeper walking around each horse and jiggling the platforms and seats and spraying some liquid from a pressure can first into the hole and then over the wienie. When he is finished he opens the gate to a crowd of children. They all rush in screaming and laughing to pick the size they want. There are ten sizes of wienie on the horses&#x2014;varying in width and thickness&#x2014;the holes are smallest in diameter on the horses with the biggest wienies. Two little girls start to fight over which one will get the last horse of the biggest size. They pull each other's ponytails and kick and finally roll on the :8oor biting and scratching and screaming. Meanwhile a boy of about three comes up to the horse&#x2014;feels of its wienie&#x2014;pulls his short elastic-topped trousers down and lies down on the platform on his belly. All the little boys except this one are now perched in the seats behind the tails with their pants down. All the little girls except these two are now lying on their backs on the platforms with their skirts up. All the children have their feet braced in stirrups. <br> &nbsp;<br> The merry-go-round is arranged so that even at the limits of the horse's travels up and down it never is not touching both the children. The merry-go-round keeper twists a button and it begins to move. Slow at first and then faster. The children are fixed in place on their seats and platforms and the horses plunge up and down and the whole moves around gaining speed in a circle. The two little girls are still fighting on the floor between two of the plunging horses and each time the merry-go-round comes around I catch and lose sight of them in an instant. With each revolution the waltz music goes up a decibel until all the other sounds are washed away. The parents standing on the ground are all nodding and showing their teeth and the children on the horses are holding very still but moving their lips and showing their teeth. I look up at the uniform for though we are not walking his groin gun is bumping my buttocks in time with the music. He is nodding and showing his teeth but when he sees me looking he stops and shoves me forward giving my shoulder a jerk and digging his thumb into my neck.<br> &nbsp;<br> We move away from the merry-go-round quickly but just as we reach the street he stops and looks back smiling. Just then the music halts abruptly and all the other sounds in the square sweep back. Over them hangs a scream already seconds old. About-face-double-time-in-and-out-through-the-crowd-we've-just-left-back-to-the-merry-go-round-uniform-panting-and-Dogsbody-jouncing-on-my-shoulders-like-chain-mail-;oh-shriek-a-giggle-crane-a-neck-such-a-crowd-hmmm! And in the middle you-and-I old incapacitated Dogsbody so very with this bright young uniform splurging through to the center&#x2014;the merry-go-round and who knows what Sister Blendina is up to?<br> &nbsp;<br> And just off the center of the center&#x2014;which is to say on the floor of the merry-go-round between the now stopped once moving horses&#x2014;a boy. Or once a boy. Lying on his back, eyes closed&#x2014;little trousers down around his knees-little buttocks flattened bare upon the floor-blood running from his groin. The uniform knows but he says:<br> &nbsp;<br> "What happened?" and is deluged by answers:<br> &nbsp;<br> "The horse behind his&#x2014;the flaring nostrils&#x2014;he reached&#x2014;his thumb caught in the nostrils&#x2014;oooh!&#x2014;my poor darling&#x2014;it ain't the company's fault! we give 'em all instructions&#x2014;one horse went up and the other went down&#x2014;you see, sir, he's so short&#x2014;only five years old&#x2014;stretched! a broken thumb&#x2014;and he wasn't circumcised, I promised his grandfather never to&#x2014;severed penis, cauterization indicated."<br> &nbsp;<br> Because the chain on his waist was too short the uniform could not crouch down without making us both fall so he bent from the waist to pick the boy up&#x2014;clump over his shoulder&#x2014;-balanced with one hand. "Where ya takin him&#x2014;shouldnya call an ambulance?&#x2014;do you think he'll be all right?"<br> &nbsp;<br> "Sure he'll be all right folks, now don't you worry. I'm taking him over to the academy. He's ours now. They'll fit him out with a laser police special and whip him into one of Mizoorah' s finest. Why fifteen years from now he'll be strutting around proud as you please and mighty glad all this happened."<br> &nbsp;<br> All the smiles and nods and murmuring that goes on is left behind as we march off&#x2014;me carrying Dogsbody and the uniform carrying the boy. We cross the street and walk up the steps of a large gray building. The boy's stump is dripping blood on my shoulders so I ask "What place is this?"<br> &nbsp;<br> The uniform points to the roman caps above the door:<br> &nbsp;<br> INDEPENDENCE JAIL<br> &nbsp;<br> While I'm reading it Dogsbody slumps down even worse and her face slips around on mine so I can't see or hear or even breathe. While I'm pushing the face back into place we move along and some things happen that I can't be sure of. By the time I can see again, we're standing in front of a counter with people behind it. The boy has disappeared and the uniform is telling me to take off my watch and glasses and hand over my purse. I do these things slowly leaving the glasses until last because I'm watching one of the women behind the counter. She's sitting at a typewriter moving her hands very quickly. I can see she has a Dogsbody too-Mizoorah style-but in fine working order. She's looking at me and it must show badly that mine is out of commission because she doesn't look the usual hatred of meeting another Dogsbody&#x2014;just disgust.</p><h2>The Works of Henry David Thoreau</h2><p>The works of Thoreau in one collection with active table of contents.

His five previous novels in the Bruno series are <i>Bruno, Chief of Police; The Dark Vineyard; Black Diamond; The Crowded Grave;</i> and <i>The Devil&#x2019;s Cave,</i> all international best sellers. He lives in Washington, D.C., and the Dordogne.1<br><br>As if determined to make it his last sight on earth, the dead man clutched what at first appeared to be a small painting on canvas or parchment. Bruno moved closer and saw that it was no painting but rather a large and beautiful banknote, nearly twice the size of the undistinguished but familiar euro notes in his wallet.<br><br>Impeccably engraved in pastel hues stood Mercury with his winged heels before a port teeming with sailing vessels and steamships. Facing him was a bare-chested Vulcan with his forge against a backdrop of a modern factory with tall chimneys belching smoke. It was a Banque de France note for one thousand francs of a kind that Bruno had never seen before. On the quilted coverlet that was tucked up tightly to the corpse&#x2019;s grizzled chin lay another banknote, of the same style and value. Picking it up, Bruno was startled by its texture, still thick and crinkly as if made more of linen than paper. It was the reverse side of the same kind of note the dead man held. Against a cornucopia of fruits and flowers, a proud cockerel and sheaves of wheat, two medallions contained the profiles of a Greek god and goddess. They stared impassively at each other against the engraved signatures of some long-dead bank officials, and above them was printed the date of issue: december 1940.<br><br>His eyebrows rose. For any Frenchman 1940 was a solemn year. It marked the third German invasion in seventy years and the second French defeat. But it was the first time Paris had fallen to German arms. In 1870, the capital had withstood months of siege before French troops, under the watchful eye of the kaiser&#x2019;s armies, stormed the capital to defeat and slaughter the revolutionaries of the Paris Commune. The Germans who invaded in 1914 were eventually defeated. But in 1940, France had surrendered and signed a humiliating armistice. German soldiers had marched through the Arc de Triomphe and down the Champs-�lys�es and launched an occupation that would last for more than four years. France under Marshal P�tain&#x2019;s Vichy regime had retained some shred of sovereignty over a truncated half of the country, while the Germans took over Paris, the north and the whole Atlantic coastline. So it was a Vichy banknote Bruno held in his hands, and he wondered how long after the war&#x2019;s end it had remained legal tender.<br><br>There were more notes, for varying amounts, inside a black wooden box that lay open at the dead man&#x2019;s side. Alongside them were some old photographs. The one on top showed a group of young men and boys carrying shotguns, revolvers and elderly submachine guns. They were grouped around a black Citro�n Traction Avant, one of the most handsome cars France ever made. A French tricolore flag was draped across the hood.<br><br>Bruno picked up the photo and turned it over to see the scrawled words Groupe Valmy, 3 juillet, 1944. Most of the individuals were dressed like farmers, some wore berets, and two had the old steel helmets from the 1914&#x2013;�1918 war. An older man sported a French officer&#x2019;s uniform with leather straps across his chest and ammunition pouches. He held up a grenade in each hand. Each of the men had an armband with the letters ffi. Bruno knew it stood for Forces Fran�aises de l&#x2019;Int�rieur, the name de Gaulle had chosen for the Resistance fighters. Another photo showed the same car and an ancient truck parked beside a train. The doors of a freight car were open, and men in a human chain were passing sacks from the train to the truck. On the back of the photo were the words Neuvic, 26 juillet, 1944.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never been allowed to see inside his box before,&#x201d; said the woman Father Sentout had introduced as Jos�phine, one of the dead man&#x2019;s three daughters. She eyed the photos but made no move to touch them or the banknotes. Her hands, work worn and gnarled, remained clenched in her lap. She looked to be in her sixties. The priest was packing away the breviary and holy oils he had used to give the last rites. Spots of oil gleamed on the dead man&#x2019;s forehead, where the priest had made the last sign of the cross, and on his eyelids.<br><br>&#x201c;Eighty-six,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;A good age, a long life and he served France. Your father is with our Father in heaven now.&#x201d; He put his hand gently on the woman&#x2019;s arm. She shook it off.<br><br>&#x201c;We could have done with that money when I was growing up,&#x201d; she said, staring dry eyed at the banknotes. &#x201c;They were hard times.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was the banknotes that made me call you,&#x201d; said Father Sentout, turning to Bruno. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the law says about them, being out of date.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re part of his estate, so they&#x2019;ll go to his heirs,&#x201d; said Bruno. &#x201c;But those photos mean I&#x2019;ll probably have to plan for a special funeral.&#x201d; He turned to Jos�phine. &#x201c;Do you know if he had the Resistance medal?&#x201d;<br><br>She gestured with her head to a small picture frame on the wall above the bed, below a crucifix. Bruno leaned across the bed to look closer. The curtains were open, and the sun was shining, but only a modest light came from the tiny courtyard. He saw the stone wall of a neighbor&#x2019;s house barely six feet away. A single lightbulb hanging from the ceiling in a dingy parchment lampshade did little to help, but he could make out the small brass circle with its engraved Cross of Lorraine hanging from a black-and-crimson ribbon. Beneath it in the frame was a faded FFI armband and a photograph of a young Murcoing wearing it and holding a rifle.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to check the official list but it looks like he qualifies for a Resistance funeral with a guard of honor and a flag for the coffin,&#x201d; Bruno said. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s what you want, I&#x2019;ll make the arrangements. The state pays for it all. You can either have him buried at the big Resistance cemetery at Chasseneuil or here in St. Denis.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was wondering if he&#x2019;d left enough to pay for cremation,&#x201d; she said, looking around the small bedroom with its faded floral wallpaper and a cheap wardrobe that had seen better days. &#x201c;He was waiting for a place in the retirement home, so the mairie stuck him in here.&#x201d;<br><br>The old man had lived alone in the small apartment formed from the ground floor of a narrow three-story house in one of the backstreets of St. Denis. Bruno remembered when the mairie had bought the building and converted it for social housing. Four families were stuffed into the upstairs apartments, and another from the waiting list would be moved into this place as soon as the old man was removed. The recession had been hard on St. Denis.<br><br>&#x201c;Paul should be here by now,&#x201d; she said, looking at her watch. &#x201c;His grandson, my sister&#x2019;s boy. I called him as soon as I called the priest. He&#x2019;s the only one my dad ever had much time for, the only other man in the family.&#x201d; She looked sourly at the corpse in the bed. &#x201c;Three daughters weren&#x2019;t enough for him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll need your phone number to let you know about the funeral,&#x201d; Bruno said, taking out his notebook. &#x201c;Do you know where he kept his papers, if there&#x2019;s a will?&#x201d;<br><br>She shrugged and gave her number. &#x201c;Nothing much to leave.&#x201d; She looked at her watch again. &#x201c;I have to go. I&#x2019;ll take whatever food he&#x2019;s left.&#x201d; Through the open door they heard her rummaging in the small fridge and the food cupboard before she stomped down the narrow passage beside the garage that led to the street.<br><br>&#x201c;Not much sign of grief there,&#x201d; said Bruno, taking out his phone to call the medical center. A doctor would have to certify death before Murcoing could be taken to the funeral parlor.<br><br>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t have many visits from his family, except for Paul,&#x201d; the priest said. &#x201c;All the sisters live in Bergerac. Jos�phine told me she works as a night nurse, so she probably sees more than enough of the old and sick.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How sick was he? I haven&#x2019;t seen him in the caf� for a while.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He knew he was dying, and he didn&#x2019;t seem to mind,&#x201d; Father Sentout replied. &#x201c;He had pneumonia but refused to go to the hospital. That was the sickness we used to call the old man&#x2019;s friend. It&#x2019;s a peaceful passing, they just slip away.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I remember seeing him coming out of church. Was he a regular?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;His wife dragged him along. After she died he didn&#x2019;t come so often at first, but this place is close to the church so he&#x2019;d come along for Mass, for the company as much as anything.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did he ever talk about the money?&#x201d; Bruno gestured at the open box on the bed and the banknote still held tightly in Murcoing&#x2019;s dead hands.<br><br>The priest paused, as if weighing his words in a way that made Bruno wonder whether there was some secret of the confessional that was being kept back.<br><br>&#x201c;Not directly, but he&#x2019;d rail against the fat cats and the rich and complained of being cheated. It was just ramblings. I was never clear whether he thought his daughters had cheated him out of the money from the farm or if it was something else.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is there something you can&#x2019;t tell me?&#x201d;<br><br>Father Sentout shrugged. &#x201c;Nothing directly linked to the money. I presume it&#x2019;s from the Neuvic train. You know about that, right? The great train robbery by the Resistance?&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno shook his head. He&#x2019;d heard of it but not the details. These days, the priest explained, the story was more legend than anything else. A vast sum of money, said to be hundreds of millions, had been stolen from a train taking reserves from the Banque de France to the German naval garrison in Bordeaux. Despite various official inquiries, large amounts had never been accounted for, and local tradition had it that several Resistance leaders had bought grand homes, started businesses and financed political careers after the war with the loot.<br><br>&#x201c;If that was his share, he didn&#x2019;t get much,&#x201d; Father Sentout concluded, nodding at the banknotes on the bed. After the war there had been so many devaluations. Then in 1960 came de Gaulle&#x2019;s currency reform; a new franc was launched, each worth a hundred of the old ones. &#x201c;That thousand-franc banknote is probably worth less than a euro, if it&#x2019;s worth anything at all.&#x201d;<br><br>Bruno bent down to pry the note from the cold fingers. As he put it inside the box with the photographs, he heard footsteps in the corridor, and Fabiola bustled into the small room, her medical bag in tow. She was wearing a long white coat of freshly pressed cotton, and her dark hair was piled loosely atop her head. An intriguing scent came with her, a curious blend of antiseptic and perfume, overwhelming the stale air of the room. She kissed Bruno on both cheeks and shook hands with Father Sentout, pulling out her stethoscope to examine the body.<br><br>&#x201c;He obviously didn&#x2019;t take his medicine. Sometimes I wonder why we bother,&#x201d; she said, sorting through the small array of plastic jars from the pharmacy that stood by the bed. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s dead, and there&#x2019;s nothing suspicious. I&#x2019;ll leave the certificate at the front desk of the clinic so you can pick it up. Meanwhile we&#x2019;d better get him to the funeral home.&#x201d;<br><br>She stopped at the door and faced Bruno. &#x201c;Is this going to stop you from getting to the airport? I&#x2019;ll be free by five so I can do it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It should be okay. If there&#x2019;s a problem, I&#x2019;ll call you,&#x201d; he replied. Pamela, the Englishwoman Bruno had been seeing since the previous autumn, was to land at the local airport of Bergerac just before six that evening, and he was to meet her and drive her back to St. Denis. Pamela, who kept horses along with the g�tes she rented out to tourists, had been pleased to find in Fabiola a year-round tenant for one of the g�tes, and the two women had become friends.<br><br>Bruno began making calls as soon as Fabiola and the priest left. He started with the veterans&#x2019; department at the Ministry of Defense to confirm a Resistance ceremony and then called the funeral parlor. Next he rang Florence, the science teacher at the local coll�ge who was now running the town choir, to ask if she could arrange for the &#x201c;Chant des Partisans,&#x201d; the anthem of the Resistance, to be sung at the funeral. He rang the Centre Jean Moulin in Bordeaux, the Resistance museum and archive, for its help in preparing a summary of Mur�coing&#x2019;s war record. The last call was to the social security office, to stop the dead man&#x2019;s pension payments. As he waited to be put through to the right department, he looked around the apartment.<br><br>In the sitting room an old TV squatted on a chest of drawers. In the top drawer, he found a large envelope marked Banque and others that contained various utility bills and a copy of the bill of sale for Murcoing&#x2019;s farm in the hills above Limeuil. It had been sold three years earlier, when prices were already tumbling, for eighty-five thousand euros. The buyer had a name that sounded Dutch, and the notaire was local. Bruno remembered the place, a ramshackle farmhouse with a roof that needed fixing and an old tobacco barn where goats were kept. The farm had been too small to be viable, even if the land had been good. Murcoing&#x2019;s last bank statement said he had six thousand euros in a Livret, a tax-free account set up by the state to encourage saving, and just over eight hundred in his checking account. He&#x2019;d been getting a pension of four hundred euros a month. There was no phone and no address book. A dusty shotgun hung on the wall, and a fishing rod, its handle worn with years of use, stood in the corner. The house key hung on a hook beside the door. Bruno thought old Murcoing did not have much to show for a life of hard work and patriotism.<br><br>He wrote out a receipt for the gun, the box and its contents and left it in the top drawer. Beside the TV set he saw a well-used wallet. Inside were a carte d&#x2019;identit� and the carte vitale that gave access to the health service, but no credit cards and no cash. Jos�phine would have seen to that. There were three small photos, one a portrait of a handsome young man and two more with the same young man with an arm around the shoulders of the elderly Murcoing at what looked like a family gathering. That must be Paul, the favorite grandson, who was supposed to arrive. Bruno left a note for him on the table, along with his business card and mobile number, asking Paul to get in touch about the funeral and saying he&#x2019;d taken the gun, the box and banknotes to his office in the mairie for safekeeping.<br><br>As the hearse was arriving, Bruno&#x2019;s mobile phone rang, and a sultry voice said, &#x201c;I have something for you.&#x201d; The mayor&#x2019;s secretary was incapable of saying even bonjour without some hint of coquetry. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a message from some foreigner&#x2019;s cleaning woman on the road out to Rouffignac. She thinks there&#x2019;s been a burglary.&#x201d;</p><h2>Thirteen Moons</h2><p>This magnificent novel by one of America&#x2019;s finest writers is the epic of one man&#x2019;s remarkable journey, set in nineteenth-century America against the background of a vanishing people and a rich way of life.<br> <br>At the age of twelve, under the Wind moon, Will is given a horse, a key, and a map, and sent alone into the Indian Nation to run a trading post as a bound boy.

I am leaving soon for the Nightland, where all the ghosts of men and animals yearn to travel. We&#x2019;re called to it. I feel it pulling at me, same as everyone else. It is the last unmapped country, and a dark way getting there. A sorrowful path. And maybe not exactly Paradise at the end. The belief I&#x2019;ve acquired over a generous and nevertheless inadequate time on earth is that we arrive in the afterlife as broken as when we departed from the world. But, on the other hand, I&#x2019;ve always enjoyed a journey.<br><br>Cloudy days, I sit by the fire and talk nothing but Cherokee. Or else I sit silent with pen and paper, rendering the language into Sequoyah&#x2019;s syllabary, the characters forming under my hand like hen- scratch hieroglyphs. On sunny days, I usually rock on the porch wrapped in a blanket and read and admire the vista. Many decades ago, when I built my farm out of raw land, I oriented the front of the house to aim west toward the highest range of mountains. It is a grand long view. The river and valley, and then the coves and blue ridges heaved up and ragged to the limits of eyesight.<br><br>Bear and I once owned all the landscape visible from my porch and a great deal more. People claimed that in Old Europe our holdings would have been enough land to make a minor country. Now I have just the one little cove opening onto the river. The hideous new railroad, of which I own quite a few shares, runs through my front yard. The black trains come smoking along twice a day, and in the summer when the house windows are open, the help wipes the soot off the horizontal faces of furniture at least three times a week. On the other side of the river is a road that has been there as some form of passway since the time of elk and buffalo, both long since extinguished. Now, mules drawing wagons flare sideways in the traces when automobiles pass. I saw a pretty one go by the other day. Yellow as a canary and trimmed with polished brass. It had a windshield like an oversized monocle, and it went ripping by at a speed that must have been close to a mile a minute. The end of the driver&#x2019;s red scarf flagged straight out behind him, three feet long. I hated the racket and the dust that hung in the air long after the automobile was gone. But if I was twenty, I&#x2019;d probably be trying to find out where you buy one of those fast bastards.<br><br>the night has become electrified. Midevening, May comes to my room. The turn of doorknob, click of bolt in hasp. The opening door casts a wedge of yellow hall light against the wall. Her slender dark hand twists the switch and closes the door. Not a word spoken. The brutal light is message enough. A clear glass bulb hangs in the center of the room from a cord of brown woven cloth. New wires run down the wall in an ugly metal conduit. The bare bulb&#x2019;s little blazing filament burns an angry cloverleaf shape onto my eyeballs that will last until dawn. It&#x2019;s either get up and shut off the electricity and light a candle to read by, or else be blinded.<br><br>I get up and turn off the light.<br><br>May is foolish enough to trust me with matches. I set fire to two tapers and prop a polished tin pie plate to reflect yellow light. The same way I lit book pages and notebook pages at a thousand campfires in the last century.<br><br>I&#x2019;m reading The Knight of the Cart, a story I&#x2019;ve known since youth. Lancelot is waiting where I left him the last time. Still every bit as anguished and torn about whether to protect his precious honor or to climb onto the shameful cart with the malefic dwarf driver, and perhaps by doing so to save Guinevere, perhaps have Guinevere for his own true love. Choosing incorrectly means losing all. I turn the pages and read on, hoping Lancelot will choose better if given one more chance. I want him to claim love over everything, but so far he has failed. How many more chances will I be able to give him?<br><br>The gist of the story is that even when all else is lost and gone forever, there is yearning. One of the few welcome lessons age teaches is that only desire trumps time.<br><br>A bedtime drink would be helpful. At some point in life, everybody needs medication to get by. A little something to ease the pain, smooth the path forward. But my doctor prohibits liquor, and so my own home has become as strict as if it were run by hard-shell Baptists. Memory is about the only intoxicant left.<br><br>I read on into the night until the house falls quiet. Lancelot is hopeless. I am dream-stricken to think he will ever choose better.<br><br>At some point, I put the book down and hold my right palm to the light. The silver scar running diagonal across all the deep lines seems to itch, but scratching does not help.<br><br>Late in the night, the door opens again. Scalding metallic light pours in from the hallway. May enters and walks to my bed. Her skin is the color of tanned deerhide, a mixture of several bloods&#x2014;white and red and black&#x2014;complex enough to confound those legislators who insist on naming every shade down to the thirty-second fraction. Whatever the precise formula is for May, it worked out beautifully. She&#x2019;s too pretty to be real.<br><br>I knew her grandfather back in slavery days. Knew him and also owned him, if I&#x2019;m to tell the truth. I still wonder why he didn&#x2019;t cut my throat some night while I was asleep. I&#x2019;d have had it coming. All us big men would have. But through some unaccountable generosity, May is as kind and protective as her grandfather was.<br><br>May takes the book as from a sleepy child, flaps it face down on the nightstand, blows out the candle with a moist breath, full lips pursed and shaped like a bow. I hear a hint of rattle in the lungs as the breath expires. I worry for her, though my doctor says she is fine. Consumption, though, is a long way to die. I&#x2019;ve seen it happen more than once. May steps back to the door and is a black spirit shape against the light, like a messenger in a significant dream.<br><br>&#x2014;Sleep, Colonel. You&#x2019;ve read late.<br><br>Funny thing is, I actually try. I lie flat on my back in the dark with my arms on my chest. But I can&#x2019;t sleep. It is a bitter-cold night and the fire has burnt down to hissing coals. I don&#x2019;t ever sleep well anymore. I lie in bed in the dark and let the past sweep over me like stinging sheets of windblown rain. My future is behind me. I let gravity take me into the bed and before long I&#x2019;m barely breathing. Practicing for the Nightland.<br><br>survive long enough and you get to a far point in life where nothing else of particular interest is going to happen. After that, if you don&#x2019;t watch out, you can spend all your time tallying your losses and gains in endless narrative. All you love has fled or been taken away. Everything fallen from you except the possibility of jolting and unforewarned memory springing out of the dark, rushing over you with the velocity of heartbreak. May walking down the hall humming an old song&#x2014;&#x201c;The Girl I Left Behind Me&#x201d;&#x2014;or the mere fragrance of clove in spiced tea can set you weeping and howling when all you&#x2019;ve been for weeks on end is numb.<br><br>At least that last one is explainable. Back in green youth, Claire became an advocate for flavored kisses. She would break off new spring growth at the end of a birch twig, peel the dark bark to the wet green pulp, and fray the fibers with her thumbnail&#x2014;then put the twig in her mouth and hold it there like a cheroot. After a minute she&#x2019;d toss it away and say, Now kiss me. And her mouth had the sweet sharp taste of birch. In summer, she did the same with the clear drop of liquid at the tip of honeysuckle blossoms, and in the fall with the white pulp of honey-locust pods. And in winter with a dried clove and a broken stick of cinnamon. Now kiss me.<br><br>at may&#x2019;s urging, I recently agreed to buy an Edison music machine. The Fireside model. It cost an unimaginable twenty-two dollars. She tells me the way it works is that singers up North holler songs into an enormous metal cone, whereupon their voices are scarified in a thin gyre on a wax cylinder the size of a bean can. I imagine the singers looking as if they are being swallowed by a bear. After digestion, they come out of my corresponding little cone sounding tiny and earnest and far, far away.<br><br>May is relentlessly modern, which makes me wonder why she takes care of me, for I am resolutely antique. Her enthusiasm for the movies is beyond measure, though the nearest nickelodeon is half a day&#x2019;s train ride away. Sometimes I give her a few dollars for the train ticket and the movie ticket, with some money left over for dinner along the way. She comes back all excited and full of talk about the thrill of the compact narratives, the inhuman beauty of certain actresses and actors, the magnitude of the images. I have never witnessed a movie other than once in Charleston, when I dropped a nickel into the slot of a kinetoscope viewer and wound the crank until the bell rang and put the sound tubes like a stethoscope to my ears and then bent to the eyepieces. All I perceived were senseless blurs moving tiny across my mind. I could not adjust my eyes to the pictures. Something looked a little like a man, but he seemed to have a dozen arms and legs and seemed not to occupy any specific world at all but just a grey fog broken by looming vague shapes. For all I could determine of his surroundings, the man might have been playing baseball or plowing a cornfield, or maybe boxing in a ring. I lost interest in the movies at that point.<br><br>But I understand that a movie has been made about my earlier life, and May described it to me in enthusiastic detail after it played in the nearest town. The title of it is The White Chief. I didn&#x2019;t care to see it. Who wants every bit of life you&#x2019;ve ever known boiled down to a few short minutes? I don&#x2019;t need prompting.

Throughout the 1970s feminists increasingly addressed the problem of men's sexual violence against women, and many women reduced the politics of men's power to questions about sexuality. By the 1980s these questions had become more and more focused on the issue of pornography--now a metaphor for the menace of male power. Collapsing feminist politics into sexuality and sexuality into pornography has not only caused some of the deepest splits between feminists, but made it harder to think clearly about either sexuality or pornography--indeed, about feminist politics more generally.<p>This provocative collection, by well-known feminists, surveys these arguments, and in particular asks why recent feminist debates about sexuality keep reducing to questions of pornography.</p></p><p>Paul Mathieu is a well-known Canadian ceramist.

These two titles in Venezia's long-running Getting to Know the World's Greatest Artists series offer biographical information as well as some basic art history. In <i>Diego Velazquez</i>, for instance, children will learn that seventeenth-century patrons often relied on portraits to "show off [their] power and wealth," a fact that may help them better appreciate the lavish attire and glittery jewels on display in many of the artist's major works. <i>Winslow Homer</i> puts the engraver turned painter in context of the nineteenth-century art scene, contrasting his rustic, naturalistic style with the mannered classicism preferred by other painters of the day. The absence of a glossary and an index in the books may frustrate report writers, and statements such as "Winslow didn't care what critics thought" seem a bit bold without source citations. However, the unusually abundant full-color reproductions more than justify this series' longevity, as do Venezia's lighthearted cartoons, which foster welcome associations between "art appreciation" and "fun." <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Born the daughter of the notorious King Henry VIII and the Spanish Katherine of Aragon, young Mary was a princess in every sense of the word&#x2014;schooled in regal customs, educated by the best scholars, coveted by European royalty, and betrothed before she had reached the age of three. Yet in a decade&#x2019;s time, in the wake of King Henry&#x2019;s break with the pope, she was declared a bastard, disinherited, and demoted from &#x201c;princess&#x201d; to &#x201c;lady.&#x201d; Ever her deeply devout mother&#x2019;s daughter, Mary refused to accept her new status or to recognize Henry&#x2019;s new wife, Anne Boleyn, as queen. The fallout with her father and his counselors nearly destroyed the teenage Mary, who faced imprisonment and even death.&nbsp;<br><br>It would be an outright battle for Mary to work herself back into the king&#x2019;s favor, claim her rightful place in the Tudor line, and ultimately become queen of England, but her coronation would not end her struggles. She flouted the opposition and married Philip of Spain, sought to restore Catholicism to the nation, and fiercely punished the resistance. But beneath her brave and regal exterior was a dependent woman prone to anxiety, whose private traumas of phantom pregnancies, debilitating illnesses, and unrequited love played out in the public glare of the fickle court.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Anna Whitelock, an acclaimed young British historian, chronicles this unique woman&#x2019;s life from her beginnings as a heralded princess to her rivalry with her sister to her ascent as ruler. In brilliant detail, Whitelock reveals that Mary Tudor was not the weak-willed failure as so often rendered by traditional narratives but a complex figure of immense courage, determination, and humanity.</p><p>Anna Whitelock has a Ph.D. in history from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University. Her articles and book reviews on various aspects of Tudor history have appeared in publications including the <i>Guardian</i>, the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, and BBC History. Mary Tudor, her first book, was one of five shortlisted titles for Britain&#x2019;s prestigious annual The First Biography Prize. She was also the winner of the Arts Club Emerging Writer Award in 2010. She has taught at Cambridge and is now a lecturer in early modern history at the University of London.<p><i>Chapter One<br><br>PRINCESS OF ENGLAND</i><br>Mary, the daughter of king henry viii and katherine of Aragon, was born at four in the morning of Monday, February 18, 1516, at Placentia, the royal palace at Greenwich, on the banks of the Thames River in London. Three days later, the nobility of England gathered at the royal apartments to form a guard of honor as the baby emerged from the queen's chamber in the arms of Katherine's devoted friend and lady-in-waiting, Elizabeth Howard, countess of Surrey. Beneath a gold canopy held aloft by four knights of the realm, the infant was carried to the nearby Church of the Observant Friars.1 It was the day of Mary's baptism, her first rite of passage as a royal princess.<br><br>The procession of gentlemen, ladies, earls, and bishops paused at the door of the church, where, in a small arras-covered wooden archway, Mary was greeted by her godparents, blessed, and named after her aunt, Henry's favorite sister. The parade then filed two by two into the church, which had been specially adorned for the occasion.<br><br>Jewel-encrusted needlework hung from the walls; a font, brought from the priory of Christchurch Canterbury and used only for royal christenings, had been set on a raised and carpeted octagonal stage, with the accoutrements for the christening--basin, tapers, salt, and chrism--laid out on the high altar.2 After prayers were said and promises made, Mary was plunged three times into the font water, anointed with the holy oil, dried, and swaddled in her baptismal robe. As Te Deums were sung, she was taken up to the high altar and confirmed under the sponsorship of Margaret Pole, countess of Salisbury.3 Finally, with the rites concluded, her title was proclaimed to the sound of the heralds' trumpets:<br><br>God send and give long life and long unto the right high, right noble and excellent Princess Mary, Princess of England and daughter of our most dread sovereign lord the King's Highness.4 Despite the magnificent ceremony, the celebrations were muted. This was not the longed-for male heir, but a girl.<br><br>Six years earlier, in the Church of the Observant Friars, Henry had married his Spanish bride, Katherine of Aragon. Within weeks of the wedding, Katherine was pregnant and Henry wrote joyfully to his father-in-law, Ferdinand of Aragon, proclaiming the news: "Your daughter, her Serene Highness the Queen, our dearest consort, has conceived in her womb a living child and is right heavy therewith."5 Three months later, as England awaited the birth of its heir, Katherine miscarried. Yet the news was not made public, and with her belly still swollen, most likely with an infection, she was persuaded by her physician that she "remained pregnant of another child."6 A warrant was issued for the refurbishment of the royal nursery, and in March 1511 she withdrew to her apartments in advance of the birth.7<br><br>For weeks the court waited for news of the delivery, but labor did not come. As Katherine's confessor, Fray Diego, reported, "it has pleased our Lord to be her physician in such a way that the swelling decreased."8 There was no baby.<br><br>Luiz Caroz, the new Spanish ambassador, angrily condemned those who had maintained "that a menstruating woman was pregnant" and had made her "withdraw publicly for her delivery."9 Many councillors now feared that the queen was "incapable of conceiving."10 Fearing her father's displeasure, Katherine wrote to Ferdinand in late May, four months after the event, claiming that only "some days before" she had miscarried a daughter and failing to mention the subsequent false pregnancy. Do "not be angry," she begged him, "for it has been the will of God."11<br><br>Hope soon revived, and while writing letters of deceit to her father, Katherine discovered she was pregnant once more.12 Seven months later, on the morning of New Year's Day, bells rang out the news of the safe delivery of a royal baby. It was a living child and a son; England had its male heir. Celebrations engulfed the court and country, and five days later the child was christened and proclaimed "Prince Henry, first son of our sovereign lord, King Henry VIII." The king rode to the Shrine of Our Lady at Walsingham in Norfolk to give thanks and hold a splendid joust in his son's honor. But the celebrations were short-lived. Three weeks later Prince Henry died. It did not augur well. Over the next seven years, failed pregnancy followed failed pregnancy, each ending in miscarriage, stillbirth, or infant death.<br><br>So when in the spring of 1515 the thirty-one-year-old queen fell pregnant for the seventh time, there was a somewhat subdued response. This pregnancy, however, followed its natural course, and in the early weeks of the New Year the royal couple moved to the royal palace at Greenwich, where Henry had been born twenty-four years before and where preparations were now under way for the queen's confinement.<br><br>The Royal Book, the fifteenth-century book of court etiquette for all such royal events drawn up by Margaret Beaufort, Henry VIII's grandmother, outlined the necessary arrangements. The queen's chamber was to be turned into a tapestried cocoon, the floor covered with thickly laid carpet; the walls, ceiling, and windows hung with rich arras and one window left loosely covered to allow in air and light. The wall tapestries, the queen's canopied bed, and the bed hangings were to be of simple design, with figurative images avoided for fear of provoking dreams that might disturb mother and child.<br><br>There was to be a cupboard stacked with gold and silver plate to signify the queen's status, and crucifixes, candlesticks, images, and relics placed on an altar before which she could pray. At the foot of her canopied bed was placed a daybed, covered with a quilt of crimson satin and embroidered with the king and queen's arms, where the birth would take place.13<br><br>In late January, with all made ready, Katherine began the ceremony of "taking her chamber." First she went to the Chapel Royal to hear Mass; then, returning to the Presence Chamber, she sat beneath her cloth of estate--the mark of her rank--and took wines and spices with members of the court. Lord Mountjoy, her chamberlain, called on everyone to pray that "God would give her the good hour"&#x2014;safe delivery--and the queen was accompanied to the door of her bedchamber in solemn procession. There the men departed, and Katherine entered the exclusively female world of childbirth. As The Royal Book stipulated, "All the ladies and gentlewomen to go in with her, and no man after to come in to the chamber save women, and women to be inside."14 She would not be in male company again until her "churching," the purification after labor, thirty days after the birth. Officers, butlers, and other servants would bring all manner of things to the chamber door, but there the women would receive them.<br><br>After days of seclusion and hushed expectancy, the February dawn was broken with bells ringing in the news: the queen had delivered a healthy baby, but a girl. Writing two days later, Sebastian Giustiniani, the Venetian ambassador, assured the doge and Senate that he would offer their congratulations but added that, had the baby been a son, "[he] should have already done so, as in that case, it would not have been fit to delay the compliment."15 Eventually, the ambassador sought an audience with King Henry and congratulated him "on the birth of his daughter, and on the wellbeing of her most serene mother Queen." The state would have been "yet more pleased," he added, "had the child been a son." Henry remained optimistic. "We are both young," he insisted; "if it was a daughter this time, by the grace of God, sons will follow."16<br></p></p><h2>Real Skills with Readings: Sentences and Paragraphs for College, Work, and Everyday Life 4th Edition (Instructor&#39;s Edition)</h2><p>Note: This is a stand-alone textbook.

During his imprisonment, he wrote most of the poems that have earned him the reputation as the greatest poet of the Christian mystical tradition. The poems, presented here in a beautifully printed, lightly illustrated Spanish/English edition, often blur the line between romantic and religious love, in the tradition of Song of Songs. "On a Dark Night," for example, begins with a lover whose gender is not identified, stealing out of a house, down a secret ladder, following "my only light and guide / the light that burned in my heart," to find "the one I knew would come, / where surely no one would find us." The poem ends with a breathtaking image of spiritual and sensual contentment: "On the ramparts / while I sat ruffling his hair / the air struck my neck / with its gentle hand, / leaving my senses suspended. / I stayed; I surrendered, / resting my face on my Beloved. / Nothing mattered. / I left my cares / forgotten among the lilies." These are poems to read aloud to a lover, poems to read silently before God, poems that quiver before the world's beauty and thankfully seek to describe something beyond it--a God whose undeniable intimacy with humanity always edges toward the ineffable. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i></p>San Juan de la Cruz, the great sixteenth-century Spanish mystic, is regarded by many as Spain&#39;s finest poet. Passionate, ecstatic, and spiritual, his poems are a blend of exquisite lyricism and profound mystical thought. In The Poems of St. John of the Cross, John Frederick Nims presents his superlative translation of the complete poems, re-creating the lyrical fervor of St. John&#39;s art.</p><h2>White Mischief: The Murder of Lord Erroll</h2><p>Just before 3 am on January 24th, 1941, when Britain was preoccupied with surviving the Blitz, the body of Josslyn Hay, Earl of Erroll, was discovered lying on the floor of his Buick, at a road intersection some miles outside Nairobi, with a bullet in his head. A leading figure in Kenya&#39;s colonial community he had recently been appointed Military Secretary, but he was primarily a seducer of other men&#39;s wives. Sir Henry Delves Broughton, whose wife was Erroll&#39;s current conquest, had an obvious motive for the murder, but no one was ever convicted and the question of who killed him became a classic mystery, a scandal and cause celebre. Among those who became fascinated with the Erroll case was Cyril Connolly. He joined up with James fox for a major investigation of the case in 1969 for the SUNDAY TIMES magazine. After his death, James Fox inherited the obsession and a commitment to continue in pursuit of the story both in England and Kenya in the late 1970s. One day, on a veranda overlooking the Indian Ocean, Fox came across a piece of evidence that seemed to bring all the fragments and pieces together and convinced him that he saw a complete picture.</p><p>James Fox was born in Washington DC in 1945 and educated in England.

After discovering at a very young age that she possessed certain psychic gifts and the ability to make contact with spirits of the dead, she developed an intense interest in the world of the occult. In the summer of 1969 she was formally introduced to witchcraft and spiritualism by an older family member, and has since devoted her personal life and writing career to educating the public about the ways of the Craft.<br>As a teenager, Gerina Dunwich (using a different nom de plume at the time) began writing poetry, short stories, magazine articles, and stage plays complete with musical scores. Her first published newspaper article,&nbsp;<i>His Voice was His Vehicle,</i>&nbsp;was an interview with singer/songwriter Jim Peterik from the rock n&#x2019; roll group, the Ides of March (and later, Survivor). Co-written with her cousin, Barbara Williams, it was published in October 1976.<br>By the spring of 1980 Gerina Dunwich was publishing a small press literary journal called&nbsp;<i>Golden Isis,</i>&nbsp;a one-woman operation that specialized in Goddess-inspired poetry and offbeat fiction. Its international circulation grew to nearly 3600 and it attracted subscribers from places as far away as Puerto Rico, Australia, Italy, and Japan.&nbsp;<i>Circle of Shadows</i>&nbsp;- a collection of Gerina&#x2019;s own poetry, was self-published a decade later.<br>After visiting Salem, Massachusetts, in April of 1984, Gerina relocated to the North Shore of Boston, residing first in Beverly, and then in Ipswich. In the winter of 1986, she purchased the historic Moses Day Homestead - a stately 17th century Colonial house in Haverhill that had been built around the time of the infamous Salem witchcraft trials. The house, which had been featured in a local television documentary about haunted houses in the Boston area, was a hotbed of paranormal activity. Soon after moving there, Gerina experienced a vivid dream in which the spirit of the late witchcraft author Sybil Leek appeared and whispered to her that her destiny as an author was "written in the stars." The dream proved to be prophetic when, in 1987, Gerina landed her first book contract with Citadel Press. (Appropriately, the contract was dated October 31st.) The following year saw the publication of her first book,&nbsp;<i>Candlelight Spells,</i>&nbsp;and the start of her successful career as a prolific book author.<br>In December of 1993 she moved into a century-old Victorian mansion located in the quaint and historic town of Fort Covington, New York. She soon opened a small shop on High Street called "The Country Witch" (later renamed "The Calico Cat Whatnot Shop"), which sold antiques, curios and various occult supplies. (Coincidentally, the antique shop run by Sybil Leek in the New Forest was also located on a High Street.) The business proved to be instrumental in bringing together many of the area's Pagans, including several who would later become Gerina's close friends and members of her coven.<br>In February of 1998 Gerina Dunwich received a ministerial license from the Universal Life Church. Ironically, the first handfasting she performed as a legally ordained minister was for the younger brother of the cousin who had introduced her to witchcraft nearly thirty years earlier.<br>Gerina has been a guest on numerous radio talk shows throughout the United States and Canada. She has lectured and presented workshops at festivals and gatherings across the country, including the CraftWise Pagan Gathering (Waterbury, Connecticut), the Real Witches' Ball (Columbus, Ohio), and Panpipes' Pagan Day Festival (West Hollywood, California).<br>She is a member of the International Ghost Hunters Society, the Author&#x2019;s Guild, and the Fellowship of Isis.

Inspired by the nineteenth-century British educator Charlotte Mason, this approach to self-education combines careful observation of nature with the introspection of journal writing and the relaxing pleasure of watercolor. When used with children it can become a science or art curriculum. Anyone who is interested in journal writing will love it. Discovery journals are fun for all ages and are particularly rewarding for families and educators. It is a great hobby for parents and children to share together. The whole family is able to participate and learn together.</p><p>Some days are wild days with ringing phones, buzzing doorbells, beeping microwaves, pagers and clocks. There are mounds of laundry and dishes and junk mail and bills to sort and process. There are places to be, appointments to keep, a list of things to do that lengthens twice for every item crossed off. Most of it has no meaning. It is the backlash of our efficient, industrialized society, where we try to do everything, all the time, every day. Picking up the dry-cleaning, rotating the tires on the car, returning the weekend videos. Yes, the logical mind argues, &#39;It must be done.&#39; But how and when do we recharge our symbolic batteries and fill the empty recesses of our own hearts? These many details crowd out time for our own souls. We need time away from our hectic lives to live, to connect with ourselves, our world, our creator and one another. Where in our planners do we fit the nourishing, expansive delights of writing down our thoughts about life, of watching a spider build her web, of prayer, or of looking into the eyes of a child to find who lives there? So when days are wild, I grab a journal and pen and head out the door. I leave behind the phones and buzzers, beeps and lists. I tell my children and parents, friends or husband, &#34;I&#39;m going crazy; you come too.&#34; So we go to some wild place to watch the clouds, the river, the birds, the blossoms, the wildlife. It&#39;s like coming home. Home to the planet where I was born and where I grow. A place where my body can rest while my spirit soars. I have with me my loved ones, my thoughts, an open heart for discovery, and my journal to record my wild days. I bring my journal to capture these golden moments: the sudden stillness of a deer watching, the smell of rain in the pines, the songs of hidden birds, my bigger children helping the smaller ones to cross a stream, the taste of sun-filled wild blackberries. I record these in my journal in words and pictures. They will feed me on darker days.Karen Skidmore Rackliffe has been a pioneer and a leader for fourteen years in the rapidly growing home school movement.

Tying his huge yellow sofa atop their car and packing an extra tent just for him, they set out. At first, trees are a problem, but Amos learns to maneuver in time to confront a surprised skunk and to chase a marauding bear, each after a string of hot dogs Amos has other plans for. A silly premise, but the resulting adventures continue to be engaging--especially as elaborated in Schneider's cartoon-style art, where Amos's relaxed, totally guileless interest in his own comfort has its own charm. (Picture book. 4- 8) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Kindergarten-Grade 4-- VAROOM! Here comes Amos, the old Irish setter who can make his couch move. It's hard to imagine the child who finishes reading this new title and not returning to the dog's previous escapades. The book owes everything to the expressive, eye-catching, animated aspects of the best comic-strip drawing. The story relies on episodes of camping shtick such as fishing, bears, and getting lost, and Seligson and Schneider make these adventures in the woods seem wonderful. Amos is no canine couch potato--he's a real winner. --Anna Biagioni Hart, Sherwood Regional Library, Alexandria, VA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Essence of Okinawan Karate-Do (Shorin-Ryu) (English and Japanese Edition)</h2><p>Sequential photographs illustrate in detail the forms, stances, and techniques of the Matsubayashi School of the Okinawan martial art of self-defense</p><p><b>Shoshin Nagamine</b> was a practitioner and master of Okinawan karate-do for more than sixty years.

Ginger Summit and Jim Widess authors of <i>The Complete Book of Gourd Crafting</i> and <i>Making Gourd Musical Instruments</i> pay tribute to an ancient craft in a volume both inspirational and instructional. It&#x2019;s packed with images of dolls from different cultures and eras, filled with testimonials from the most creative artists working today, and brimming with advice and irresistible projects. Summit and Widess explain how to choose a gourd, mold one as it&#x2019;s growing, clean it properly and safely, pyrograph and sculpt faces, create movable joints, and make such creatures as a simple, limbless Stump Doll; beaded Zulu doll; endearing Hobgoblin; and stacked Mother and Daughter dolls.</p><p>I have always been interested in handcrafts of all types, since a young child. I drew upon this interest often in my career as a Special Education teacher. Soon after retiring in 1990, I discovered the world of gourdcraft. After a fruitless search for books on the topic, Jim Widess and I agreed that the time was right for a new book, and a whole new world opened up! Artists around the country responded with enthusiasm and creativity to our inquiries, and the resulting books reflect the tremendous potential that the gourd has provided humans since earliest times. The great appeal of gourds to the craft world lies in their flexibility: the variety of shapes and textures of this ancient plant always suggest new possibilities to the crafter. Gourds can be embellished and adapted to work with all mediums available to artists today, and can be enjoyed for individuals with all levels of skill. In addition to growing gourds, I have been able to explore cultures and unimagined areas of human activity, from very functional containers to highly artistic expressions of music, dance, art and culture identities. It has been a great satisfaction to participate in the great gourd world, passing on a traditiion that has been such an important part of human history.</p><h2>Deadliest Sea: The Untold Story Behind the Greatest Rescue in Coast Guard History</h2><p><p><em>Deadliest Sea </em>by Kalee Thompson is the spellbinding true story of the greatest rescue in U.S. Coast Guard history. Recounting the tragic sinking of the&nbsp;fishing trawler, <em>Alaska Ranger</em>, in the Bering Sea and its remarkable aftermath in March 2008, <em>Deadliest Sea </em>is real life action and adventure at its finest. The full story of an amazing rescue&#x2014;where extraordinary courage, ingenuity, will, and technology combined in one of the most remarkable maritime feats ever recorded&#x2014;has never been told before now. It&#x2019;s <em>The Perfect Storm </em>meets <em>Deadliest Catch.</em></p></p><p><p>Soon after 2:00 A.M. on Easter morning, March 23, 2008, the fishing trawler <em>Alaska Ranger</em> began taking on water in the middle of the frigid Bering Sea. While the first mate broadcast Mayday calls to a remote Coast Guard station more than eight hundred miles away, the men on the ship's icy deck scrambled to inflate life rafts and activate the beacon lights, which would guide rescuers to them in the water. By 4:30 A.M., the wheelhouse of the <em>Ranger</em> was just barely visible above the sea's surface, and most of the forty-seven crew members were in the water, wearing the red survival suits&#x2014;a number of them torn or inadequately sized&#x2014;that were supposed to keep them from freezing to death. Every minute in the twenty-foot swells was a fight for survival. Many knew that if they weren't rescued soon, they would drown or freeze to death.</p><p>Two Coast Guard helicopter rescue teams were woken up in the middle of the night to save the crew of the <em>Alaska Ranger</em>. Many of the men thought the mission would be routine. They were wrong. The helicopter teams battled snow squalls, enormous swells, and gale-force winds as they tried to fulfill one guiding principle: save as many as they could. Again and again, the helicopters lowered a rescue swimmer to the ocean's surface to bring the shipwrecked men, some delirious with hypothermia, some almost frozen to death, back to the helicopter and to safety. Before the break of dawn, the Coast Guard had lifted more than twenty men from the freezing waves&#x2014;more than any other cold-water Coast Guard rescue in history.</p><p><em>Deadliest Sea</em> is a daring and mesmerizing adventure tale that chronicles the power of nature against man, and explores the essence of the fear each man and woman must face when confronted with catastrophe. It also investigates the shocking negligence that leads to the sinking of dozens of ships each year, which could be prevented and makes commercial fishing one of the most dangerous occupations in the world.</p><p>With deft writing and technical knowledge, veteran journalist Kalee Thompson recounts the harrowing stories of both the rescuers and the rescued who survived the deadly ordeal in the Bering Sea. Along the way, she pays tribute to the courage, tenacity, and skill of dedicated service people who risk their own lives for the lives of others. </p><p>Kalee Thompson is a freelance writer who covers science, the environment, and the outdoors.

With it you can harness the magickal power of the universe. How do you do it? By learning the ancient Chinese art of breath, posture, and sensory awareness as explained in <em>Chi Gung </em>by L. V. Carnie.</p> <p>As you learn this system to direct your flow of chi, you will be able to achieve ultimate health and things you have only dreamed of:</p> <ul> <li>Look and feel younger</li> <li>Add healthy years to your life</li> <li>Progress faster in martial arts training</li> <li>Develop different types of psychic ability: heal at a distance, talk with spirits, move objects with your mind</li> <li>Increase your fitness level</li> <li>Help damaged tissue heal more quickly</li> <li>Improve sexual performance</li> <li>Learn to control your body temperature</li> <li>Bond with your pets or with animals in the wild</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><em>Chi Gung</em> is filled with simple but effective exercises for mind, body, and spirit that will open your flow of chi as they open you to a whole new world of possibilities. No other chi gung self help book covers such a broad range of material or presents the actual training techniques for mastering the more advanced skills.</p> <p>The exercises include simple stretches and slow movements with creative visualization and breathwork. One technique that is fully explained is called the small circulation, or the microcosmic cycle. It will teach you to circulate your chi around your body and head without having it enter your arms or legs. Another technique, the grand circulation or heavenly cycle, teaches you to move chi throughout your entire body. It's not difficult, and you can do it no matter your current level of health or fitness.</p> <p>The powerful techniques here can be used alone or within any spiritual or magical system. Add them to what you are doing today!</p></p><p>Would you like to be able to heal yourself or others? How about communicate with spirits or pick up the energies within objects? Would you like to be able to use your mind to make things move? And would you like to do all of this without any sort of expensive paraphernalia? Then you need to get <i>Chi Gung</i> by L. V. Carnie. <br> <br>This is truly an astonishing book, filled with all sorts of rarely revealed techniques. The book instructs in everything from diet to exercise. It shows you how to prepare mentally, physically, emotionally, and spiritually. It teaches the exercises you need to learn in order to see what the energy of the body (called "chi) feels like, how to enhance it and cycle it throughout your body, and then how to use it for everything from healing to magick. <br> <br>You'll discover that breathing properly is the single most important concept in chi gung. It enables you to increase or decrease the amount and flow of chi in your body. There are three main styles of breathing for chi gung: natural breathing (what happens when you concentrate on the movements or positions of the various exercises while not thinking about any breathing pattern), Buddhist breathing (deep breathing that coordinates your breathing with the movement of your diaphragm and stomach muscles), and Taoist reverse breathing (the opposite of Buddhist breathing). How they are used is explained in the book. <br> <br>The practice of the techniques in this book will help you to stay sharp and even get smarter. They will help you withstand heat, cold, and pain. They will even help you to defend yourself by discovering how to sense danger. <br> <br>In a very real sense, the possibilities that are open to a student of chi gung are almost limitless. If you are already practicing any system of magick, spirituality, or martial arts, &nbsp;you owe it to yourself to add the techniques of <i>Chi Gung </i>to your practices. <br><p>L.V.

He has also previously written the Eisner-nominated <i>Superboy</i>.*Starred Review* Fans of comics will attest that creator-owned stories are the cream of the crop, and it doesn&#x2019;t get any sweeter than Lemire&#x2019;s Sweet Tooth series. The concluding volume in the series, Wild Game brings to a close 40 issues and nearly four years of work by Lemire (Underwater Welder, 2012), and longtime fans of the series will be relieved by the satisfying ending to what has been an emotional ride. The series takes place in a postapocalyptic world where an ancient sickness dwindled humanity&#x2019;s numbers and created a forgotten race of human-animal hybrids. The story follows a young antlered Gus, the alleged first hybrid, and Jepperd, a man scarred by loss and determined to protect the boy, as they search for the Alaskan lab housing the answers to the recent destruction of humanity. Lemire comes as a package deal, both writing and drawing the story, and in that synergy, his words and art live harmoniously on the page, from expression to action, allowing his deceptively simplistic drawing style to shine.

Visit her website at www.margaretmaron.com.In the fourteenth installment of her Judge Deborah Knott series, Maron highlights the tensions of new real-estate development as longtime rural residents cope with the changes brought by farms giving way to sprawling houses and big-box chain stores. When county commissioner Candace Bradshaw is murdered, some see it as her comeuppance for brokering under-the-table deals between developers and certain county commissioners. Others, however, such as Candace&#x2019;s much older ex-husband, know that Candace grew up dirt poor and had an almost physical need for luxurious possessions. Deborah&#x2019;s new husband, Sheriff Dwight Bryant, investigates the murder, and surprising revelations emerge about just how Deborah was appointed judge. In addition, Maron introduces a satisfying subplot about Deborah&#x2019;s father, Kezzie, a former major-league bootlegger who has never lost his taste for the big con. All of the machinations are delivered in a chatty style rife with colorful country expressions. As always, the mystery, neatly resolved, intersects with the home- and community-centered concerns of the large Knott family. Satisfying reading for both series fans and those new to the author. --Joanne Wilkinson</p><h2>A Dangerous Woman: American Beauty, Noted Philanthropist, Nazi Collaborator - The Life of Florence Gould</h2><p><p><b>A revealing biography of Florence Gould, fabulously wealthy socialite and patron of the arts, who hid a dark past as a Nazi collaborator in 1940&#x2019;s Paris.</b></p><p>Born in turn-of-the-century San Francisco to French parents, Florence moved to Paris at the age of eleven. Believing that only money brought respectability and happiness, she became the third wife of Frank Jay Gould, son of the railway millionaire Jay Gould. She guided Frank&#x2019;s millions into hotels and casinos, creating a luxury hotel and casino empire. She entertained Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, Joseph Kennedy, and many Hollywood stars&#x2015;like Charlie Chaplin, who became her lover. While the party ended for most Americans after the Crash of 1929, Frank and Florence stayed on, fearing retribution by the IRS. During the Occupation, Florence took several German lovers and hosted a controversial Nazi salon. As the Allies closed in, the unscrupulous Florence became embroiled in a notorious money laundering operation for Hermann G�ring&#x2019;s Aerobank.</p><p> Yet after the war, not only did she avoid prosecution, but her vast fortune bought her respectability as a significant contributor to the Metropolitan Museum and New York University, among many others. It also earned her friends like Est�e Lauder who obligingly looked the other way. A seductive and utterly amoral woman who loved to say &#x201c;money doesn&#x2019;t care who owns it,&#x201d; Florence&#x2019;s life proved a strong argument that perhaps money can buy happiness after all.</p></p><p>Born and raised in the United States, SUSAN RONALD has lived in England for more than twenty-five years.

Readers may not recall the name Bethany Hamilton, but after a glance at the cover photo, they'll recognize her as the girl who lost her arm to a shark while surfing. Hamilton tells her own story, though in many places the narrative sounds more like it's from an adult's perspective--perhaps from an adult coauthor. It begins with the moment a giant white shark chomps off her arm. She then goes back to discuss the events leading up to the attack and to describe what her life was like before the tragedy--home-schooling in a strong Christian household and lots of competitive surfing. Hamilton's account is suffused with her feelings for God and His impact in her life. Perhaps because of this relationship, she never seems depressed about her situation; in fact, she is surfing again. The inset of color photos offers further insight into Hamilton's life. Although this may quickly date, it has automatic appeal for a wide range of readers. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

After serving as a combat medic in the Pacific during World War II, Coldsmith served as a physician in Emporia, Kansas, until 1988 when he closed his office to devote himself to writing. Coldsmith and his wife, Edna, maintain a small ranching operation, and have raised cattle, Apaloosa horses, and five daughters, not necessarily in that order.<br>Daughter of the Eagle<br>1Eagle Woman moved gracefully around the dance arena, stepping precisely to the beat of the big dance drum. She had been a warrior sister for three seasons now, a priestess of the Elk-dog Society. Admiring glances from young warriors of the band told her reassuringly that she made a fine appearance as she fulfilled the ceremonial function at the opening of the Warriors' Dance.Her white buckskin dress, with intricate quill work, was of the finest, reflecting her skills and those of her mother. Her glossy hair was parted and braided flawlessly, shining with blue-black highlights like the wing of a crow.It was said that her looks were much like those of her grandmother, Tall One, at the same age. The older woman, still handsome in her maturity, was said to have been the most beautiful of her generation. She was the wife of Heads Off, chief of the Southern band of the People, known as the Elk-dog band because of their skill with the horse.To that couple had been born two sons of distinction. The younger was now medicine man of the band, skilled in prediction, in healing, and, most of all, with the buffalo. Itwas said that of all medicine men in the entire tribe, none had stronger buffalo medicine than that of Owl.The elder son, called Eagle from his earliest days, was now a respected subchief, one of the most important leaders of his warrior society. That was, in fact, how his daughter had become a warrior sister.Eagle Woman enjoyed the ceremony, the pageantry, and the responsibility of the honored office. Besides, there were other advantages. She wished some day to marry and to raise strong warriors and capable women of the People. Yet there had been no suitor that came close to her ideals. A very independent girl, she had preferred competition with the young men rather than romance.As children in the Rabbit Society, both sexes received instruction in the use of weapons and in athletic skills. The young daughter of Eagle had been aggressive and talented in her learning. Soon the others were jokingly calling her by her father's name, adding the feminine "woman." As names sometimes do, the appellation stuck, and she became Eagle Woman. The girl gloried in the implication and pushed harder to perfect the warrior skills.Her masculine pursuits may have frightened away some suitors. Yet others seemed intrigued by her differences, and the persistence of one or two was becoming annoying. It was with some degree of relief, therefore, that Eagle Woman accepted the honor of becoming a warrior sister.This position required a vow of chastity, so in effect she could decently sidestep any unwanted proposals. Her reason was the best. Her office in a warrior society forbade such activity.There was only a slight gnawing of doubt in the back of her mind. Sometimes in the darkness, in the privacy of her own sleeping robes, Eagle Woman wondered. Was there something wrong with her? She had watched her contemporaries pair off in marriage until no woman her own age remained single. Even one of the other warrior sisters had resigned the honored office to marry.Now, at nearly nineteen summers, Eagle Woman was theoldest unmarried woman in the tribe. Basically, however, she was happy with her lot. Her demeanor radiated confidence and satisfaction, which may have only added to her beauty.Eagle Woman continued to step around the circle to the beat of the drum and the chant of the song, moving right to left with the other two warrior sisters. She passed her brother, Bobcat, seated at the edge of the arena, and he smiled proudly at her. He was two summers older, mischievous, and teasing, but he was obviously proud of his sister, her position of honor, and her well-recognized reputation for beauty.The girl did not return his smile but maintained the stolid dignity of the ceremony. Straight before her and stiffly upright stood the eagle feather in each hand, symbolic of far vision and courage.She passed others of her family as she circled. Her grandfather, the chief, sat with Tall One, both now showing the snow of many winters in their hair. The People had prospered under the leadership of Heads Off and the Elk-dog medicine he had brought from his far tribe. There were hardly people alive now who remembered a time before the horse. It was as if the Elk-dog had always been.Eagle Woman stepped past the point where her own parents were seated, acknowledging their presence with a glance. Eagle was seated with his left leg extended before him, rather than squatting or sitting cross-legged like most of the People. He had walked with a limp since before Eagle Woman could remember. There had been a stampede during a buffalo hunt, with the young warrior swept away by the frantic animals. Badly injured, he had been missing for six moons, given up for dead. There had been strange circumstances about his rediscovery, but she could not remember. Something to do with her uncle Owl, the medicine man.Suddenly Eagle Woman almost jumped, startled by the gaze of a young man at the circle's edge. She knew him well, had known him all her life. He was Long Walker, son of one of the chiefs of the Elk-dog band. The two childrenhad always been rivals. On the few occasions when Eagle Woman had been bested in athletic skills or proficiency with weapons, her opponent had been this young man. At times she had hated him for his ability. Always he was a relentless competitor, keen and quick, ready to laugh at her discomfiture in defeat.Now she read a new expression in the smiling face. His gaze was one of unabashed admiration. The girl was shocked, because she had never thought of him in this way. Long Walker was a rival, a competitor, not a potential romantic figure. She was irritated by his bold stare and shrugged him off with a toss of her raven braids. Outwardly she remained perfectly stoic, still wondering at this turn of events.She knew that Long Walker had no wife. That was a matter of some wonderment in the band, too. He was quite eligible. Though still living in his parents' lodge, he owned many horses in his own right. His lack of interest in marriage had led to whispered speculation as to whether he might choose to be a woman-man. Still, he had not yet started to cross-dress, and he had a good reputation in the hunt.Again Eagle Woman was irritated at herself for even wondering. What matter to her if some conceited young warrior wanted a wife or not? It was no concern of hers. She had better things to think about.Copyright � 1984 by Don Coldsmith</p><h2>Eyebody - The Art of Inegrating Eye, Brain and Body -- and letting go of glasses forever</h2><p>Improving vision and understanding the relationship between their vision, body, thoughts and emotions.</p><p></p><h2>Demonglass (A Hex Hall Novel) (A Hex Hall Novel, 2)</h2><p>Sophie Mercer thought she was a witch. <br><br>That was the whole reason she was sent to Hex Hall, a reform school for delinquent Prodigium (aka&nbsp;witches,&nbsp;shapeshifters, and fairies).

She lives with her family in Alabama, and is currently at work on the third book in the Hex Hall series.

Sophie is surrounded by handsome boys: her crush, demon-hunter Archer Cross, and the hunky but taciturn magical healer Cal. Although this second title lacks the plentiful humor of the first, narrator Sophies delivery is still delightfully brash, and the many action scenes lend a cinematic feel.

It was written in the 1950s when both Constance Spry and Rosemary Hume were among the greatest names in cookery writing at the time. Their aim was to offer a supremely practical book with chapters covering kitchen processes, soups and sauces, through vegetables, meat, poultry and game to cold dishes and pastry making. In fact everything every cook, or aspiring cook, would need to know. <br><br>That the book has been so popular for over half a century is a true testament to how successfully they achieved their aim. The Constance Spry Cookery Book is now an established classic (and much requested on wedding gift lists) and a timeless treasure which stands the test of time, and is perhaps even more needed today when so many people have not been taught to cook by mothers or at school. It truly is the only cookbook you will ever need.</p><p>Rosemary Hume had opened her cooking school &#x2018;Ecole du Petit Cordon Bleu&#x2019; in London in the early 1930s having graduated from the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in Paris and in 1945 went on to become co-principal of the London school where she helped and encouraged many of the world&#x2019;s best cooks. She was a leading cookery writer of her day and was awarded an MBE before her death in 1984 at the age of 76.<br><br>Born in Derby but brought up and educated in Ireland, Constance Spry opened a small flower shop behind Victoria Station in London in the late 1920s and in the 30s this was followed by a school of flower arranging in Mayfair. Spry's outstanding skill and creativity made her much in demand at the highest social levels and her flower decorations became famous throughout the world; she was responsible for the flower arrangements at the wedding and coronation of the Queen. She became joint principal with Rosemary Hume of the Cordon Bleu Cookery School in London and later opened Winkfield Place, a residential school near Windsor, where young women could learn the complete art of cookery and entertaining. Before she died in 1960 Constance Spry had written twelve books on cookery and flower decoration."(This) book is 1,197 pages of sound advice ad sexy recipes (from vol-au-vents a l 'Indienne and oeufs Valencia to Edinburgh rock and tomato ice- very contemporary), a monument to 'civilised living' and the 'homelier arts'.

Coppola wearily asked one of his assistants after a long day of shooting on <b>The Godfather</b>. <br>"Always remember three things. Have the definitive script ready before you shoot. There'll always be some changes, but they should be small ones. Second, work with people you trust and feel secure with. Remember good crew people you've worked with on other films and get them for your film. Third, make your actors feel very secure so they can do their job well."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Pausing for a moment, Coppola considered his advice.<br> <br>"I've managed to do none of these things on this film," he concluded.<br><br>Francis Ford Coppola is one of the seminal filmmakers of the generation that changed the way movies are made. Five of the films he's worked on are listed among the American Film Institute's top 100 films ever made. He is a man who's spent his life seeking to realize his own artistic vision even as he acknowledges the force that truly drives Hollywood--box office receipts. <br><br>Francis Ford Coppola: A Filmmaker's Life is the first complete picture of the flawed cinematic genius who directed the Godfather trilogy, Apocalypse Now, The Conversation, and other distinctive films--some wildly successful, some disastrous.<br><br>Coppola is on every film aficionado's list of Hollywood's greatest directors. But he is renowned nearly as much for his mistakes as for his masterpieces, for his bluster as for his brilliance, for the money he has lost as for the fortunes he has made. In an era when playing it safe seems to be the credo of the Hollywood/Wall Street complex, Coppola is a driven, unpredictable renegade who has repeatedly gambled everything in an effort to bring his ideas to life, regardless of the cost. <br><br>In Francis Ford Coppola, we hear the entire story of this man's career covered in more detail than ever before: from his apprenticeship under Roger Corman to his winning a Director's Guild Lifetime Achievement Award. Along the way, we learn how he turned a pulp Mafia novel into a cinematic classic, how he almost literally killed himself during the filming of Apocalypse Now, and how he confirmed Hollywood's predictions about him, with various flops and follies along the way.<br><br>In the hands of biographer Michael Schumacher--who gained unprecedented access to Coppola's friends, critics, peers, casts, and crews--the story of Francis Ford Coppola makes for irresistible reading and the first complete picture of this complex, conflicted genius.</p><p>The terrible fact about Francis Ford Coppola's career is that it will always be divided evenly in half, down a line called <i>Apocalypse Now</i>. Before that film is prodigious promise--an Academy Award for writing <i>Patton</i>, two uncannily fine <i>Godfather</i> movies, and the Antonioni-esque smallness of <i>The Conversation</i>. After, there is telescoping debt, talk of reinventing the studios, and multiple, hollow exercises in style. If that's a tough assessment, it's one borne out by this thick, fair biography. The author, Michael Schumacher, who has previously published books on Allen Ginsberg and Eric Clapton, makes much of Coppola's boyhood spell of polio, from which he emerged miraculously healthy and movie-mad. He orchestrated his life thereafter with a consequent mania, as though making up for lost time. While still in film school, he sold screenplays and made Z-budget drive-in movies for Roger Corman. In two years, he wrote 12 scripts for 7 Arts, and in the mid-1960s started a family, made <i>You're a Big Boy Now</i> and <i>Finian's Rainbow</i>, pushed George Lucas to write <i>THX1138</i>, founded American Zoetrope, and took a job, purely for the money, directing <i>The Godfather</i>. The chapters on <i>Apocalypse Now</i> are the book's highlights, and without saying as much they explain the spent quality at the core of Coppola's films in the next two decades. After hurricanes in Manila, Marlon Brando, and the ungodly beauty of those helicopters at dawn, whose career wouldn't wing straight to twilight? <i>--Lyall Bush</i>&#x201c;Schumacher has executed a book that&#x2019;s wall-to-wall action.&#x201d; <br>-- San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>&#x201c;Schumacher&#x2019;s book is a treat.&#x201d; <br> -- Tampa Tribune</p><h2>The Veiled Prophet (Diablo: The Sin War, Book 3)</h2><p>Since the beginning of time, the angelic forces of the High Heavens and the demonic hordes of the Burning Hells have been locked in the Eternal Conflict for the fate of all Creation.

This diverse collection of writings approaches the myth from many perspectives--historical, literary, psychological, and ecological--and sheds light on the myth&#39;s ancient meaning as well as offering new insights into its contemporary implications.</p><p>Heavily footnoted and broad in scope, this collection begins by examining the inconsistencies of the earliest versions of the Demeter and Persephone myth by Homer and Ovid. By cross-referencing classic and modern thought with literary, cultic and agrarian views, Downing ( The Goddess ) allows the "various interpretations to contradict, complement, complicate, and ultimately enrich one another." Among the issues debated are Demeter's true character and motivations (nurturing, selfless mother vs. obsessed neurotic); the "necessity" of Persephone's rape (a commonplace cruelty vs. her own desires of womanhood); maidenhood vs. menopause; homosexual vs. heterosexual love; the secrets of the Eleusinian mysteries and the Thesmophoria; and life vs. death/renewal. Despite centuries of gender bias in the myth's retelling and translations, Downing and her contributors reclaim the myth as their own: "We hoped that the discovery of a prepatriarchal world," the editor posits, "might help us imagine forward to a postpatriarchal one." Standout contributions include "Learning From My Mother Dying" by Carol P. Christ, poetry by Alma Luz Villanueva and Herta Rosenblatt and John Daughters's wickedly funny "Hades Speaks." <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>From Coach to Awakener</h2><p>Coaching is the process of helping people and teams to perform at the peak of their abillities.

This allows her to include how these women have been interpreted - not only in the Bible itself, but also in Jewish and Christian traditions and by modern commentators. The result is a thoroughly engaging and insightful look at women, from a leading biblical interpreter who has a very creative edge to all her work.</p><p>Athalya Brenner is Professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of Amsterdam (Netherlands) and Roslyn and Manny Rosenthal Distinguished Professor-in-Residence at Brite Divinity School (Fort Worth, Texas).

No other flower has ever carried so much cultural baggage: it charts political upheavals, illuminates social behavior, mirrors economic booms and busts, and plots the ebb and flow of religious persecution. </p><p>Sumptuously illustrated from a wide range of sources, this beautifully produced and irresistible volume has become a bible, a unique source book, a universal gift book, and a joy to all who possess it. Now available in paperback, it's as irresistible as its subject.</p></p><p>In an auction held in Holland in February 1637, 99 lots of tulip bulbs fetched a staggering 90,000 guilders, more than $3.5 million in today's money. Tulipomania had reached its height, and its story is told in just one of the fascinating sections of Anna Pavord's wonderful book on this most seductive of flowers.<p> Pavord's passion for the flower is evident from the opening pages of the book, where she tells of scrambling across the hillsides of Crete in search of an obscure, indigenous purple tulip. The story of the discovery of this tulip leads into Pavord's extraordinary history of this beautiful, enigmatic flower. As with all the best love stories, Pavord's is told from the perspective of the object of affection--in this case, the tulip--from its adoption by the Ottoman sultans of Istanbul in the 18th century to its present cultivation by the Wakefield Tulip Society.</p><p> Along the way, incredible stories of people's investments in the flower emerge, the result, as Pavord explains, of a unique feature of the tulip. Its variegated colors are produced by a small parasitic aphid, which weakens the plant but produces its gorgeous hues. The tulipomania that gripped 17th-century Europe was a form of futures trading, as people purchased tulip bulbs at increasingly inflated prices with the hope that they would flower into the most beautiful and kaleidoscopic colors imaginable. <i>Tulip</i> is an extraordinary book, beautifully illustrated and offering a fascinating story of our obsession with the most ephemeral of objects. Buying tulip bulbs will never be the same again. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i></p><p><b>Anna Pavord</b> is the gardening correspondent for the <i>Independent</i>, and the author of <i>The Flowering Years</i> and <i>Gardening Companion</i>.

Terry Naughton, head of Orange County&#39;s new Crimes Against Youth Division, has his work cut out for him when he faces The Horridus--a madman who kidnaps children, then releases them unharmed but dressed in period clothing with a piece of snakeskin as a memento 12-city author tour. TV ads (Psychological Suspense) .</p><p>What novelist T. Jefferson Parker does so well in <i>Where Serpents Lie</i> (and in such previous high-octane outings as <i>Laguna Heat</i> and <i>Pacific Beat</i>) is to bind his characters tightly to the territory in which they live and die--the mostly scorched and urbanized but occasionally still pristine turf of Southern California's Orange County. When he's not running the Crimes Against Youth unit at the Orange County Sheriff's Department, Terry Naughton sits in a cave in Laguna Canyon, drinking tequila, smoking cigars, and trying to understand the twisted mind of a particularly vicious child molester called The Horridus. The serpents of the title are real, as is the terror Parker manages to evoke with the intense power of his writing. "I knew that there was no way that Lauren would ever have her childhood replaced with a better one," Naughton says about a 9- year-old girl sold for sex by her parents. "Lauren had the resigned eyes and the aura of passive invincibility found in nearly all children who have escaped to the last place they can go--to the private, silent cave of their own selves."to look <i>Where Serpents Lie?</i><br>He takes them from their beds at night and releases them unharmed within a day--dressed like little angels with a piece of snakeskin tucked into the folds of their gowns as a memento. They are blindfolded and gagged throughout the ordeal, so they cannot describe their captor--nor do they know what happened while they were in his care. (Thank God.)<br>Terry Naughton, head of Orange County's Crimes Against Youth unit, faces the challenge of a lifetime when children are being kidnapped but released--and the people of Southern California are terrified for their safety. The cops don't know what the criminal wants--but they do know that his brand of psychotic behavior always escalates in scale. Will the next child never come back?</p>
